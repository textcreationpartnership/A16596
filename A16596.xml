            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>REAT and heauy is Gods anger againſt vs, as the moſt grieuous plague of the death of our late King (a Prince of all that euer was ſince Chriſts aſcenſion into Heauen, in any Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, peerleſſe) doth Prognoſticate. For when Gods iudgement hath begun with his Childe, let other men thinke as they can, I ſurely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded otherwiſe, but that a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and bitter cuppe of Gods vengeance, is ready to be poured out for vs Engliſh-men to drinke. The whelpe God hath beaten to fray the bandogge: Iudgement is begun at Gods houſe: In Gods mercie to him-wards, hee is taken away, that his eyes ſhould not ſee the miſeries which we ſhall feele.</p>
            <p>He was too good to tarry with vs, ſo wicked,<note place="margin">

I wil not goe about to paint vs out in our colours: God by his plagues and vengeance, I feare me, will paint and point vs out: Wee haue ſo mocked with him and his Goſpell, that we ſhall feele it is no bourding with him.</p>
            <p>Of long time we haue couered our couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and carnality, vnder the cloake of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; ſo that all men ſhall ſee vs to our ſhame, when he ſhall take his Goſpell away, and giue it to a people that will bring forth the fruits of it: To let his Goſpell tarry with vs, he cannot; for we deſpiſe it, contemne it, are glutted with it. Since his Goſpell came amongſt vs, we ſay now, we had neuer plenty; therefore, againe, let vs goe and worſhip the Queene of heauen, and to prouoke the Lord to anger. The earth cannot abide now the words and Sermons of <hi>Amos.</hi>

So that, I ſay, God cannot let his Goſpell tarry with vs, but muſt needes take it away, to doe vs ſome pleaſure therein: for ſo ſhall we thinke for a time; as the Sodomitanes thought, when <hi>Lot</hi> departed from them: as the old world thought,<note place="margin">

               </gap>olomitanes thought, when the Apoſtles went thence to Peltis. Then
<pb facs="tcp:16991:3"/>were they merry, then was all paſtime. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was abſent, then went they to eating and drinking, and roſe againe to play: But alas,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 32</note> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly came the floud, and drowned them: Gods wrath waxed hot againſt them. Then was lamentation, mourning and woe: then was crying out, wringing of hands, renting of clothes, ſobbing and ſighing for the miſeries fallen; out of the which they could not ſcape. Well, if hee take that away, for a time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, we ſhall be quiet, but at length we ſhall feele the want to our woe, at length hee will haue at vs, as at them.</p>
            <p>O bee thou mercifull vnto vs, and in thine anger remember thy mercy: We haue ſinned, we haue ſinned, and therefore art thou angrie; ô be not angry for euer. Giue vs peace, peace, peace in the Lord: ſet vs to worke againſt ſin, againſt Sathan, againſt our carnall deſires, and giue vs the victory this way. This victory we obtaine by faith. This faith is not without Repentance, as her Gentleman-Vſher before her.</p>
            <p>This Vſher then, Repentance, if wee truely poſſeſſed, wee ſhould be certaine of true faith, and ſo aſſured of the victory ouer death, hell, and Sathan. His workes then which hee hath ſtirred vp, would quaile, God would reſtore vs politique peace, right ſhould be right, and haue right: Gods Goſpell ſhould tarrie with vs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould bee cheriſhed, Superſtition ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: and ſo we yet ſomething happy, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great loſſe of our moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:16991:4"/>Liege, ſouereigne Lord. All theſe would come to paſſe you ſee, if the Gentleman-Vſher I ſpeake of, I meane, Repentance, were at Inne with vs. As if he be abſent, we may be certaine, that Lady Faith is abſent. Wherefore, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be vanquiſhed of the world, the fleſh, and the diuell, and ſo wil Sathans workes proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, though not in all things to bleare our eyes, yet in that thing which he moſt of all deſireth. Therefore, to Repentance, for our ſelues pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, and for the Realme and Church pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, euery one ſhall labour to ſtirre vp both our ſelues and others. This, to the end, that for my part I might helpe, I haue preſently put forth a Sermon of Repentance, which had lyen by me halfe a yeere at the leaſt, for the moſt part of it. For, the laſt Summer, as I was abroad preaching in the Countrey, my chance was to make a ſermon of Repentance, the which was earneſtly of diuers deſired of me, that I ſhould giue it them written, or elſe put it forth in print, which I could not doe, for I had not written it, and ſo I told them.</p>
            <p>But when no nay would ſerue, I promiſed to write it as I could, at my leiſure; this leiſure I prolonged ſo long, that (as I think) I offended them: ſo did I pleaſe my ſelfe, as one more glad to reade other mens writings, then in ſuch ſort to publiſh mine owne, for other men to reade: not that I would others not to profit by mee, but that I, knowing how ſlender my ſtore is, would be loth, the enemies ſhould therby take occaſion of ſpeaking.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:16991:4"/>
            <p>But when I conſidered this preſent time, to occaſion men now to look vpon all things, in ſuch ſort as might mooue them to godlineſſe, rather then to any curious queſtioning: I, for the ſatisfying of my promiſe, and profiting of the ſimple, ignorant, and rude, haue now cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Sermon to be printed: the which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God for his Chriſts ſake, to vſe as a mean, whereby of his mercie, it may pleaſe him to worke in me, and many others, true hearty repentance for our ſinnes, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his name.</p>

            <p>GOdly Learned men doe write &amp; publiſh bookes, to profit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> age in which they liue, and the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This deſire was in the Authour of this Treatiſe, M. <hi>Iohn Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> who preached &amp; publiſhed this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Repentance. And now that we, which do liue after him, and are the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, may take as much or more profit by it, then they did for whom it was firſt preached &amp; publiſhed it is by new imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting publiſhed againe. Nothing is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this Sermon, or altered in it: only to the Sermon of Repentance is added another Sermon of the Lords Supper, which he alſo made, and was neuer prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before. And aptly are they ioined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For in peruſing of the laſt, thou ſhalt ſee how neceſſarily he draweth the doctrine of Repentance to them al, which do with due preparation receiue the holy Sacrament of Chriſt. They are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:16991:5"/>the moſt profitable Teachers, which haue good experience by practiſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, of that which they doe teach to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſuch as may ſafely ſay; <hi>Brethren, be ye followers of me, &amp; look on them which walke ſo, as ye haue vs for an example, Phil. 3.17.</hi> And ſurely, ſuch a patterne was M. <hi>Bradford</hi> in his life time, of this doctrine of Repentance: for I knew him familiarly, and muſt needes giue to God this prayſe for him, that (among men) I haue ſcarce knowne one like vnto him. I did know when, and partly how it pleaſed God, by effectuall calling to turne his heart vnto the true knowledge, and obedience of the moſt holy Goſpell of Chriſt our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Of which God did giue him ſuch an heauenly hold and liuely feeling, that as he did then know, that many ſinnes were forgiuen him, ſo ſurely hee declared by deeds that he loued much. For where he had doth giftes and calling, to haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelfe in ciuill and worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires profitably; ſuch was his loue of Chriſt, and zeale to the promoting of his glorious Goſpel, that after that God had touched his heart, he changed, not onely the courſe of his former life, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did, <hi>Luke 7.</hi> but euen his profeſſion and former ſtudy, as <hi>Paul</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, hee preſently ſold his Chaynes, Rings, Brooches, &amp; Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of gold, which before he vſed to weare,
<pb facs="tcp:16991:6"/>and did beſtow the price of this his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vanity, in the neceſſary reliefe of Chriſts poore members, which he could heare of, or finde lying ſicke, or pining in pouerty. Touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond, the change of his ſtudy; and being in the inner Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>London,</hi> at the ſtudy of the common Lawes, hee went to Cambridge to ſtudy Diuinity, where he heard D. <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> diligently, and was right familiar and deare vnto him. In this godly courſe he did (by Gods bleſſing) ſo profit, that that bleſſed Martir, D. <hi>Ridley,</hi> then B. of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> did, as it were, inuite him and his godly companion, M. <hi>Tho.

Pſalm:</hi> and there in one Sermon, ſhewing the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods iudgement at hand, for the contempt of the Goſpel, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, vpon the Sabboth day, going in a Whirry to <hi>Paris Garden,</hi> to the Bearebai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting were drowned: and that a dogge was met at Ludgate, carying a piece of
<pb facs="tcp:16991:6"/>dead child in his mouth: he with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Propheticall ſpirit ſayd. I ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you all, euen euery mothers child of you, to the iudgement of God, for it is at hand; as it followed ſhortly after, in the death of K. <hi>Edward.</hi> In which ſtate and labour of preaching he continued, till the cruelty of the Papiſts cut him off; as the hiſtory of his life and death (compiled by that faithfull ſeruant of the Lord Ieſus, M. <hi>Iohn Foxe</hi>) ſheweth.</p>
            <p>In all ſtops and ſtayes, in his labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calling, he was much helped forward by a continuall meditation, and practiſe of repentance &amp; faith in Chriſt; in which he was kept by Gods grace, notably exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed all the dayes of his life. Euen in this meane time hee heard a Sermon, which that notable Preacher, M. <hi>Latimer</hi> made before K. <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6.</hi> in which bee did earneſtly ſpeake of reſtitution to bee made of things falſly gotten: which did ſo ſtrike <hi>Bradford</hi> to the heart, for one daſh of a pen which hee had made, without the knowledge of his maſter (as full often I haue heard him confeſſe with plenty of teares) being Clarke to the Treaſurer of the Kings Campe beyond the Seas, and was to the deceiuing of the King, that he could neuer be quiet, till by the aduice of the ſame M. <hi>Latimer,</hi> a reſtitution was made. Which things to bring to paſſe, hee did willingly forbeare and forgoe all
<pb facs="tcp:16991:7"/>the priuate &amp; certaine Patrimony which he had in earth. Let all bribers and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Officers learne their leſſon here.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, our <hi>Bradford</hi> had his daily exerciſes and practiſes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. His maner was, to make to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a Catalogue of all the groſeſt &amp; moſt enorme ſinnes, which in his life of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he had committed, &amp; to lay the ſame before his eyes when he went to priuate praier, that by the ſight &amp; remembrance of them, the better to ſtir him vp to offer to God the ſacrifice of a contrite heart, and to pray for pardon and the increaſe of grace, to the deteſtation of ſin, and loue of obeying the good will of God.</p>
            <p>His manner was this: Hee vſed in the morning to go to the Common prayer in the Colledge where hee was, and after that, hee vſed to make ſome prayer with his Pupils in his Chamber. But not content with this, he then repaired to his own ſecret praier, by himſelf, as one that had not yet praied to his own mind: for he was wont to ſay to his familiars, I haue prayed with my ſelfe. Let ſecure men mark this, which pray without touch of breſt, as the Phariſe did; and ſo that they haue ſayd an ordinary prayer, or heare a common courſe of prayer, without any thing els, they thinke they haue prayed wel, and as the terme is, they haue ſerued
<pb facs="tcp:16991:7"/>God wel. Let vs learne by <hi>Bradfords</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to pray better, that is, with the heart, and not with the lips alone, <hi>Quia Deus non vocis, ſed cordis auditor eſt,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth: that is, <hi>Becauſe God is the hearer of the heart, and not of the voice:</hi> that is to ſay, not of the voice alone without the heart, for that is but lip-labour. This conſcience of ſin, and exerciſe in prayer had <hi>Bradford,</hi> cleane contrary to that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed cuſtome of thoſe graceleſſe men, which doe ioy to make large accounts of their lewdneſſe, and do glory therein; ſo feeding their delights with their liues paſſed, as the dogge returneth to ſmell of his caſt gorge, and the horſe to his dung; ſuch as the Prophet, <hi>Eſay 39.</hi> ſaith: <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their ſinnes as Sodome, they hide them not, woe be to their ſoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of his exerciſes was his: He vſed to make vnto himſelfe an <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> or a <hi>Iournall,</hi> in which he vſed to write all ſuch notable things, as either he did ſee or heare, each day that paſſed. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he did heare or ſee, he did ſo pen it, that a man might ſee in that booke, the ſignes of his ſmitten heart. For, if hee did heare or ſee any good in any man, by that he found and noted the want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in himſelfe, and added a ſhort prayer, crauing mercy, and grace to amend. If hee did heare or ſee any plague or miſery, hee noted it as a thing procured by his
<pb facs="tcp:16991:8"/>owne ſinnes, and ſtill added, <hi>Domine, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere mei, <hi>Lord, haue mercy vpon me.</hi>
               </hi> He v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſame booke to note ſuch euill thoughts as did riſe in him; as of enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good of other men, thoughts of vnthankfulneſſe, of not confidering God in his workes, of hardnes of heart, when he did ſee other moued and affected. And thus he made to himſelfe, and of himſelfe, a booke of daily practiſes of repentance.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, they which familiarly kept company with him, might ſee how he vſed to fall often into a ſudden and deepe meditation, in which hee would ſit with fixed countenance and ſpirit moued, yet ſpeaking nothing a good ſpace. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in this ſilent ſitting, ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of tears ſhould trickle downe his cheeks, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he would ſit in it, and come out of it with a ſmiling countenance. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue I ſate at dinner and ſupper with him, in the houſe of that godly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer of many Preachers and ſeruants of the Lord Ieſus, I meane M. <hi>Elſyng,</hi> when either by occaſion of talke had, or of ſome view of Gods benefits preſent, or ſome inward cogitation and thought of his owne, he hath fallen into theſe deepe cogitations, and afterward he would tell me of them, that I did perceiue, that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his teares trickled out of his eyes, as well for ioy, as for ſorrow. Neither was hee onely ſuch a practiſer of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb facs="tcp:16991:8"/>in himſelfe, but a continuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoker of others thereunto, not onely in publike preaching, but alſo in priuate conference and company: for in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies where he came, hee would freely reproue any ſin and miſbehauiour which appeared in any perſon; eſpecially ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, filthy talkers, and popiſh praters: and this hee did with ſuch a diuine grace and chriſtian maieſtie, that euer he ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the mouthes of the gaine-ſayers: for be ſpake with power; and yet ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they might ſee their euill to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and vnderſtand that it was good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, to the which hee laboured to draw them in God.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, as his life was, ſuch was his death: for at his death, as the Hiſtory witneſſeth, when the flames of fire did fly about his eares in Smithfield, his laſt ſpeech, publikely noted &amp; heard was this, <hi>Repent England.</hi> Thus was our <hi>Bradford</hi> a Preacher, and an example of that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which he preached: As <hi>Ionas</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to Niniue (and yet doth) hee preach repentance; and ſurely England hath now much more cauſe to repent, then it had when <hi>Bradford</hi> liued: for all ſtates and ſorts of perſons in England, are now more corrupt, then they were then.</p>
            <p>Let therefore now <hi>Bradfords</hi> Sermon, his life, his death, moue thee, O Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to repent; I wiſh and warne, that

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He life we haue at this preſent, is the gifte of God, in whom we liue, moue; and are; and therefore hee is called <hi>IEHOVA,</hi> For the which life, as wée ſhould he thankfull, ſo may we not in any wiſe vſe it after our corrupt fantaſies; but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16991:11"/>to the end for which it is giuen and lent vs, that is: to the ſetting forth of Gods praiſe and glory, by repentance, conuerſion, and obedience, to his good will and holy lawes; whereunto his long ſuffering doth, (as it were) euen draw vs, if our hearts by impenitency were no hardened. And therefore our life in the Scripture is called a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for that as the body daily draweth more and more néere his end, that is the earth: euen ſo our ſoule draweth daily more and more néere vnto death, that is, ſaluation, or damnation, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or hell.</p>
            <p>Of which thing, in that we are moſt careleſſe, and very fooles, (for we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, are the ſame to day, we were ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and not better or nearer to God, but rather nearer to hell, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and perdition; being couetous, idle, carnal, ſecure, negligent, proud &amp;c.) I think my labour cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſtowed then with the Baptiſt, Chriſt Ieſus, and his Apoſtles, to harpe on this ſtring, which of al other is moſt neceſſary, and that in theſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16991:11"/>dayes moſt ſpecially. What ſtring is that, ſaith one? Forſooth, brother, the ſtring of repentance, the which Chriſt our Sauiour did vſe, firſt in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtery; and as his Miniſter, at this preſent, I will vſe vnto you all:<note place="margin">Mat. 4.17.</note> 
               <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for the: Kingdome of heauen is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſentence thus pronounced, and preached by our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, as it doth command vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſo to the doing of the ſame, it ſheweth vs a ſufficient cauſe to ſtirre vs vp thereunto; namely, for that, <hi>The kingdome of Heauen</hi> (which is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of all ioy, peace, riches, power and pleaſure) <hi>is at hand,</hi> to all ſuch as doe ſo, that is, as do repent: So that the meaning hereof is, as though our Sauiour might thus ſpeake preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Syrs, for that I ſee you all walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wrong way, euen to Sathan, and vnto hell fire, by following the kingdome of Sathan, which now is coloured vnder the vaine pleaſures of this life, and fooliſhneſſe of the fleſh, moſt ſubtilly, to your vtter vndoing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16991:12"/>and deſtruction: behold, and marke well what I ſay vnto you: <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen,</hi> that is, an other manner of ioy and felicitie, honour, and riches, power and pleaſure, then you now perceiue of enioy; is euen at hand, and at your backes: and if you will turne againe, that is, Repent you, you ſhall moſt truly and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feele, ſee, and inherite. Turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine therefore, I ſay; that is <hi>Repent,</hi> for this ioy I ſpeake of, euen, <hi>The Kingdome of Heauen is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may note, firſt the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature, in that to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Repent you,</hi> he addeth a cauſe, <hi>For the Kingdome of Heauen is at hand:</hi> For by reaſon of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; ſturdines of our nature, God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his commandements, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either addeth ſome promiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs to obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or elſe ſome ſuch ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe, as cannot but tickle vs vp to harty laboring for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doing of the ſame: as here to the commandement of doing penance, he addeth this <hi>Aeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologe</hi> or cauſe ſaying: <hi>For the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heauen is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:16991:12"/>
            <p>Againe, in that hee ioineth to the Commandement the cauſe, ſaying: <hi>For the kingdom of heauen is at hand</hi> We may learne that of the kingdome of heauen, none (to whom the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of preaching doth appertaine) can be partaker, but ſuch as repent and do penance. Therfore, dearely beloued, if you regard the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, in that you cannot enter therein, except you repent: I beſeech you all of euery eſtate, as you deſire you own peace of conſcience, to repent and doe penance. The which thing that yee may doe, I wil indeuor my beſt now, to helpe you, by Gods grace.</p>
            <p>But firſt, becauſe we cannot well tell what repentance is, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and for lacke of knowledge, and falſe teaching: I will (to begin with all) ſhew you what Repentance is. Repentance, or penance is no eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh word, but wee borrow it of the Latiniſts, to whom Penance is a fore-thinking in Engliſh: in Greek, a being wiſe afterwards: in Hebrew, a conuerſion or turning; the which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16991:13"/>conuerſion or turning, in that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true and hearty, vnto God eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, without ſome good hope or truſt of pardon, for that which is already done and paſt: I may well in this ſort define it; namely, that penance is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorowing or fore thinking of our ſinnes paſt, an earneſt purpoſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, or turning to God with a truſt of pardon.</p>
            <p>This definition may be diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thrée parts: Firſt a forrowing for our ſinnes: Secondly, a truſt of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which otherwiſe may be called, a perſwaſion of Gods mercie, by the merits of Chriſt, for the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes: And thirdly, a purpoſe to amend, or conuerſion to a new life. The which third, or laſt part, cannot be called properly a part; for it is but an effect of penance, as towards the end ye ſhall ſee, by Gods grace. But leſt ſuch as ſeeke for occaſion to ſpeak euil, ſhould haue any occaſion, though they tarry not out the end of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: I therefore diuide Penance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the three foreſayd parts:</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:16991:13"/>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1</hi> Of ſorrowing for our ſinne.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>2</hi> Of good hope, or truſt of pardon.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>3</hi> Of a new life.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus you may ſee what penance is: a ſorrowing for ſinne, a purpoſe to amend, with a good hope or truſt of pardon.</p>
            <p>This penance not onely differeth from that which men commonly haue taken to be penance, in ſaying and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our enioyned Lady Pſalters, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Pſalmes, faſtings, Pilgrimages, Almes deedes, and ſuch like things; but all from that which the more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned haue declared, to conſiſt of three parts: namely, Contrition, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſatiſfaction.</p>
            <p>Contrition, they call a iuſt and a ful ſorrow for their ſinne. For this word, <hi>iuſt,</hi> and <hi>full,</hi> is one of the differences, betweene Contrition and Attrition.</p>
            <p>Confeſſion, they call, a numbering of all their ſinnes in the eare of their ghoſtly father: for as (ſay they) a Iudge cannot abſolue without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the cauſe or matter; ſo cannot the Prieſt, or ghoſtly father, abſolue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16991:14"/>from other ſinnes, then thoſe which he doth heare.</p>
            <p>Satiſfaction, they call amends ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto God for their ſins, by their vndue workes, <hi>Opera indebita, <hi>Works more then they neede to doe,</hi>
               </hi> as they terme them: This is their penance which they preach, write, and allow: But how true this ſtuffe is, how it agreeth with Gods Word, how it is to bee allowed, taught, preached, and written, let vs a little conſider. If a man repent not, vntill he haue a iuſt and full ſorrowing for his ſins (deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued) when ſhall he repent? For in as much as hel fire, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diuels, is a iuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſinne: In as much as in all ſin, there is a contempt of God, which is all goodnes, and therefore there is a deſert of all ilneſſe: alas, who can beare for feele this iuſt ſorrow, this ful ſorrow for our ſinnes, this their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, which they do ſo diſcerne from their attrition? Shall not man by this doctrine, rather deſpaire, then come by repentance? If a man repent not vntil
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16991:14"/>he haue made confeſſion of all his ſins in the eare of his ghoſtly father: if a man cannot haue abſolution of his ſinnes, vntil his ſinnes be told by tale and number in the Prieſts eare (in that as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth) none can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand much leſſe then vtter al his ſins: <hi>Delicta quis intelligit? <hi>Who can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his ſins?</hi>
               </hi> In that <hi>Dauid</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe complayneth elſe where, how that his ſinnes are ouerflowed his head, and as a heauy burthen doe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe him; alas, ſhall not a man by this doctrine, be vtterly driuen from repentance? Though they haue gone about, ſomething to make plaiſter for their ſorces of confeſſion or attrition, to aſſwage this ſrruffe; bidding a man to hope well of his contrition, though it be not ſo full as is required, and of his confeſſion, though hee haue not numbred all his ſinnes, if ſo be that he doe ſo much as in him lyeth: deerely beloued, in that there is none, but that herein he is guilty (for who doth as much as he may) thinke yee, that this plaſter is not like ſalt to ſore eies?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16991:15"/>Yes vndoubtedly, when they haue done all they can, for the appeaſing of conſciences in theſe points, this is the ſumme, that wee yet ſhould hope well, but yet ſo hope, that wee muſt ſtand in a mammering and doubting, whether our ſinnes be forgiuen. For to beleeue <hi>Remiſſionem peecatorum,</hi> that is: <hi>To be certaine of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,</hi> as our Creed teacheth vs, they count it a preſumption. O obomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that not onely herein, but in all their penance as they paint it!</p>
            <p>As concerning ſatiſfaction, by their <hi>Opera indebita, <hi>Vndue workes,</hi>
               </hi> that is: by ſuch works as they need not to do, but of their owne voluntarineſſe and wilfulneſſe: (wilfulneſſe in deed) who ſeeth not monſterous abomination, blaſphemy, and euen open fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? For if ſatiſfaction can be done by man, then Chriſt died in vain, for him that ſo ſatiſfieth, and ſo reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he in vaine; ſoi s he a Biſhop and a Prieſt in vaine. Gods lawe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth loue to God with all our heart,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.2 Mat. 22.</note> ſoule, power, might and ſtrength: to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16991:15"/>that there is nothing can bee done to Godward,<note place="margin">Mar. 20. Luke 10.</note> which is not contained in this Commandement: nothing ran be done, ouer and aboue this. Again, Chriſt requireth to man ward, <hi>That we ſhould loue one another,</hi>

               <hi>as he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs.</hi> And think you, Beloued, that we can doe any thing to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ward, which is not herein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized?</p>
            <p>Yea, let them tell mee, when they do any thing ſo in the loue of God, and their Neighbour, but that they had need to crie: <hi>Remitte nobis debita noſtra, <hi>Forgiue vs our ſinnes.</hi>
               </hi>

            <p>For to omitte the teſtimonies I brought out of <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> which the blinde cannot but ſee: I pray you remember the text out of <hi>Eſay,</hi> which euen now I rehearſed, being ſpoken to ſuch as were then the people of God, and had bin a long time, but yet were fallen into grieuous ſinnes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their adoption into the number of Gods children. <hi>It is for mine owne ſake</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that I put away thy ſinnes.</hi> Where is your parting of the ſtake now?

            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:16991:17"/>
            <p>And it is to be noted, that God doth taſt in their feeth, euen the ſinne of their firſt father, leſt they ſhould think that yet, perchance, for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and goodneſſe of their good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their ſinnes might bee the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pardoned, and ſo God accept their workes.</p>
            <p>If they had taken Satiſfaction, for that which is done to the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publikely, by ſome notable puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in the Primitiue Church was vſed to open offendors, ſparkles whereof, and ſome traces yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, when ſuch as haue ſinned in adultery, go about the Church with a Taper in their ſhirts: Or if they had made Satiſfaction for reſtitution to man ward, of ſuch goods as wrongfully are gotten, the which true penance cannot be without: Or if by Satiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they had meant a new life, to make amendes to the Congregation thereby, as by their euill life they did offend the Congregation; in which ſence the Apoſtle ſéemeth to take that which he writeth in <hi>2. Cor. 7</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:16991:18"/>where the old Interpreter calleth <hi>Apologian,</hi> Satiſfaction, which rather ſignifieth a defence or anſwering againe. If I ſay, they had taken Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction any of theſe wayes, then they had done well, ſo that the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to God had béene left all onely to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Againe, If they had made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, either for that which is to God priuatly, either for that which is to the Congregation publiquely, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that which is a frée conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with ſome one learned in Gods booke, and appointed thereunto, as firſt it was vſed; and I wiſh were now vſed amongſt vs, either for that which is a reconciliation of one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, it had béene ſome thing: yea, if they had made it for faith, becauſe it is a true demonſtration of faith: as in <hi>Paul</hi> wée may ſée, when hee calleth Chriſt the Captaine of our Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> that is, of our faith (and ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors were called in the Primitiue Church) ſuch as manfully did witnes their faith with the peril of their liues:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16991:18"/>if, I ſay, they had taken it thus, then had they done right well.</p>
            <p>And ſo Contrition, if they had left out their ſubtill diſtinction, betwéene it and Atttirion, by this word <hi>iuſt</hi> or <hi>full,</hi> making it a hearty ſorrow for their ſinnes, then wee would neuer haue cryed out againſt them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For wee ſay, penance hath thrée parts; Contrition, if you vnderſtand it for a hearty ſorrowing for ſin; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if you vnderſtand it for faith, of frée pardon in Gods mercy, by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; &amp; Satiſfaction, if you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it not to God-wards (for that onely to Chriſt muſt be left alone) but to man ward in reſtitution of goods wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully or fraudulently gotten, of name hindred by our ſlaunders, and in newneſſe of life: although, as I ſayd before, &amp; anon will ſhew more plainly by Gods grace, that this laſt is no part of penane in deed, but a plaine effect or fruit of true penance.</p>
            <p>I might here bring in examples of their penance, how perilous it is to be embraced: but let the example of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16991:19"/>their graund Sire <hi>Iudas</hi> ſerue, in whome we ſée all the parts of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnance, as they deſcribe it; and yet notwithſtanding he was damned. He was ſorie enough, as the effect ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he had their contrition fully, out of the which he confeſſed his fault, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>I haue betrayed innocent blood:</hi> and thereunto he made ſatiſfaction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the money he had receiued. But yet all was but loſt, he hanged vp himſelfe, his bowels burſt out, and he remained a child of perdition for euer. I would wiſh that this example of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> in whom ye ſee the parts of their penance, contrition, confeſſion, and ſatiſfaction, would moue them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to deſcribe it a little better, making hope or truſt of Gods frée mercy a piece thereof, or elſe with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> they will marre all.</p>
            <p>Perchance theſe words, contrition, confeſſion, and ſatiſfaction, were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as I haue expounded them at the firſt. But in that we ſée ſo much daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and hurt by vſing them without expoſitions; either let vs ioyne to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16991:19"/>them open expoſitions alwaies, or elſe let vs not vſe them at all, but ſay as I write, that penance is a hearty ſorrow for our ſinnes, a good hope or truſt of pardon through Chriſt, which is not without an earneſt purpoſe to amend, or a new life. This penance is the thing, whereto all the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs. This penance doe I now call you all vnto: this muſt bée continually in vs, and not for a Lent ſeaſon, as we haue thought: this muſt increaſe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more in vs: without this we cannot be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Search therefore your hearts all, all ſwearers, blaſphemers, lyers flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, lewd, or idle talkers, ieſters, bribers, coueteous perſons, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, gluttons, whoremongers, théeues, murtherers, ſlanderers, idle liuers, negligent in their vocation, &amp;c. All ſuch, and all other as lament not their ſinnes, as hope not in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for pardon, and purpoſe not hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to amend, to leaue their ſwearing, drunkennes, whoredome, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, idleneſſe, &amp;c. All ſuch I ſay ſhall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16991:20"/>not or cannot enter into Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but hel fire is prepared for them, wéeping, and gnaſhing of téeth: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, alas, I feare me, very many will needs goe, in that very many will be as they haue bin; let vs euen to the wearing of our tongue to the ſtumpes, preach and pray neuer ſo much to the contrary, and that euen in the bowels of Ieſus Chriſt: as now I beſéech you all; all, and euery mothers child, to repent and lament your ſinne, to truſt in Gods mercie, and to amend your liues.</p>
            <p>Now me thinkes, ye are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aſtonied: whereby I gather, that preſently you deſire this Repentance, that is: this ſorrow, good hope, and newneſſe of life. The which that you may the rather attaine, and get to your comforts, as I haue gone about to be a meane to ſtirre vp in you (by Gods grace) this deſire of Repentance, ſo through the ſame grace of God, will I goe about now to ſhew you, how you may haue your deſire in this hehalfe.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:16991:20"/>
            <p>And firſt concerning this part, namely, ſorrow for our ſinnes, and hearty lamenting of the ſame: For this, if you deſire the hauing of it, you muſt beware, that you thinke not that of your ſelues, or of your owne free will, by any meanes you can get it. You may eaſily deceiue your ſelues, and mocke your ſelues, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more of your ſelues then is ſéeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All good things, and not peeces of good things, but all good things, ſaith Saint <hi>Iames,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 1.</note> come from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of light. If therefore penance be good (as it is good) then the parts of it be good.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 2.</note> From God therefore doe they come, and not of our free will. It is the Lord that mortifieth, that bringeth downe, that humbleth, ſaith the Scripture in ſundry places:<note place="margin">Ierem. 31.</note> 
               <hi>After thou haddeſt ſtricken my thigh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ieremie</hi>) <hi>I was aſhamed</hi> Loe he ſaith, <hi>After thou haddeſt ſtricken me:</hi> and therefore prayeth he, euen in the laſt words almoſt, he writeth, <hi>Turne vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 5.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord, and we ſhall be turned.</hi> The which thing <hi>Dauid</hi> vſed very often.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:16991:21"/>
            <p>Wherfore firſt of all, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt haue part of penance, as for the whole,<note place="margin">Acts 22. 2. Tim. 2.</note> becauſe it is Gods gift; ſo for this part go thou vnto God, and make ſome little praier, as thou canſt, vnto his mercy for the ſame, in this, or like ſort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MErciful Father of our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, becauſe I haue ſinned and done wickedly; yet, through thy goodneſſe, haue receiued a deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whereto, this thy long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth draw my hard heart: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, for thy mercies ſake in Chriſt, to worke the ſame repentance in me; and by thy Spirit, Power, and Grace, ſo to humble, mortify, and feare my conſcience for my ſinnes to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in thy good time thou maiſt comfort and quicken me againe, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Ieſus Chriſt thy deerely beloued Sonne. AMEN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this ſort, I ſay, or otherwiſe, as thou thinkeſt good, if thou wilt haue this firſt part, Contrition or ſorrow for thy ſins, do thou begge it of God,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16991:21"/>through Chriſt. And when thou haſt aſked it, as I haue laboured to driue thee from truſting in thy ſelfe; ſo now I goe about to moue thee from flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thy ſelfe, from ſluggiſhneſſe, and negligence, to be diligent to vſe theſe meanes following. Vnto pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which I would thou ſhouldeſt firſt vſe as thou canſt: ſecondly, get thee Gods Law as a glaſſe to toot in: for in it, and by it, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſinne, without which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there can bee no ſorrow. For how can a man ſorrow for his ſinnes, which knoweth not his ſinnes? As when a man is ſicke, the firſt ſteppe to health, is to know his ſickneſſe: euen ſo to ſaluation, the firſt ſteppe, is to know thy damnation due for thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes.</p>
            <p>The Law of God therefore muſt be gotten, and carefully looked in; we muſt looke in it ſpiritually, and not corporally, or carnally, as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward word or letter doth declare and vtter: and ſo our Sauiour teacheth vs in <hi>Mathew,</hi> expounding the ſixt and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16991:22"/>ſeuenth Commandements, not onely after the outward déed, but alſo after the heart, making there the anger of the heart, a kind of murther; luſting after another mans wife, a kinde of adultery.</p>
            <p>And this is one of the differences, betwéene Gods Law, and mans law; that of this (mans law I meane) I am not contemnable, ſo long as I obſerue outwardly the ſame. But Gods Law goeth to the roote and to the heart, condemning mee for the inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although outwardly I liue moſt holily. As for example: If I kill no man, though in my heart I hate, mans law condemneth me not: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth Gods Law. And why? for it ſeeth the root whence the euill doth ſpring. If hatred were taken out of the heart, then loftineſſe in lookes, detraction in tongue, and murther by hand, could neuer enſue. If luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were out of the heart, curioſity in countenance, wantonneſſe in words, loathſome boldnes in body would not appeare.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:16991:22"/>
            <p>In that therefore this outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſprings out of the inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſeeing Gods Law alſo is a law of liberty, as ſayth Saint <hi>Iames:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 2. Rom. 7.</note> and ſpirituall, as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and ſpiritually it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if wee will truely come to the knowledge of our ſinnes. For of this inward corruption, reaſon knoweth little or nothing. I had not knowen (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) that luſting (which to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to them which are guided only by reaſon, is thought but a trifle:) I had not knowen (ſaith he) this luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haue been ſinne, if the Law had not ſaid, <hi>Non concupiſces, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the knowledge therefore of our ſinne (without which wee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or be ſorrie for our ſin,) let vs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly get vs Gods Law, as a glaſſe to look in: and that not only literally, outwardly, or partly; but alſo ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, inwardly and throughly. Let vs conſider the heart, and ſo ſhall wee ſee the foule ſpots wee are ſtayned withall, at leaſt inwardly, whereby
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16991:23"/>we the rather may be moued to hearty ſorrow and ſighing. For, as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſayth, it is a glaſſe which feareth no body, but euen looke what a one thou art, ſo it painteth thee out.</p>
            <p>In the Lawe, wee ſee it is a foule ſpot, not to loue the Lord our God, with all (I ſay) our heart, ſoule, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, might and ſtrength, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
            <p>In the Law it is a foule ſpot, not onely to make to our ſelues any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Image or fimilitude, to bowe thereto, &amp;c. but alſo, not to frame our ſelues wholly after the Image wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are made, not to bowe to it, or worſhip it.</p>
            <p>In the Law we ſee that it is a foule ſpot, not onely to take Gods name in vaine, but alſo not earneſtly, hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and euen continually to call vpon his name onely, to giue thankes vnto him onely, to beléeue, to publiſh, and liue in his holy word.</p>
            <p>In Gods Law, we ſee it is a foule ſpot to our ſoules, not onely to be an open prophaner of the Sabboth day,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16991:23"/>but alſo not to reſt from our owne words and workes, that the Lord might both ſpeak and work in vs and by vs; not to heare his holy word, not to communicate his Sacraments, not to giue occaſion to others to holineſſe, by our example in godly workes, and reuerent eſteeming of the Miniſtery of his Word.</p>
            <p>In Gods Lawe, wee ſee it a foule ſpot to our ſoules, not onely to bee an open diſobeyer of our Parents, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Maſters, and ſuch as bee in any authority ouer vs; but alſo not to honour ſuch euen in our hearts, not to giue thankes to God for them, not to pray for them, to ayde, to helpe, or reliue them, to beare with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In Gods Law, wee ſée it is a foule ſpot in our ſoules, not onely to bee a manqueller in hatred, malice, proud lookes, brags, back-biting, railing, or bodily ſlaughter: but alſo not to loue our neighbours; yea, our enemies, euen in our hearts, and to declare the ſame in all our geſtures, words, and works.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:16991:24"/>
            <p>In Gods law, wee ſée ſée it a foule ſpot to our ſoules, not onely to bee a whoremo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in luſting, in our harts, in wanton looking, in vncleane and wanton talking, in actuall doing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtly with our neighbours wife, daughter, ſeruant, &amp;c. But alſo not to be chaſte, ſober, temperate in heart, lookes, tongue, apparell, déeds, and to helpe others thereunto accordingly, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In God Law, wee ſee it is a foule ſpot to our ſoules, not onely in heart, to couet, in looke or word to flatter, lye, colour, &amp;c. in deed to take away any thing which pertaineth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but alſo in heart, countenance, word and deede, not to keepe, ſaue, and defend that which pertaineth to thy neighbour, as thou wouldeſt thine owne.</p>
            <p>In Gods Law, we may ſee it a foule ſpot, not onely to lye and beare falſe witnes againſt any man; but alſo, not to haue as great a care ouer thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours name, as ouer thine owne.</p>
            <p>Sinne in Gods Law it is we may ſee, and a foule ſpot, not onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16991:24"/>to euill luſt, or carnall deſires, but euen the very natural or carnal luſts, and deſires themſelues, for ſo I may call them: nature it ſelfe, being now ſo corrupted, are ſinne, and ſelfe-loue, and many ſuch like. By reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I thinke there is none that looketh well therein, but though he be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to the world, &amp; faire to the ſhew; yet certainly, inwardly his face is foule arrayed, and ſo ſhameful, ſaucy, mangy, pocky, and ſcabbed, that hee cannot but be ſorry at the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and that ſo much more, by how much hee continueth to looke in this glaſſe accordingly.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond meane, to the ſtirring vp of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our ſinne, that next vnto prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we ſhould looke in Gods low ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. The which looking, if we vſe with prayer, as I ſayd, let vs not doubt, but at the length Gods Spirit wil work, as now to ſuch as beleeue; for to the vnbeleeuers all is in vaine, (their eyes are ſtark blind, they can ſée nothing) to ſuch as beleeue (I ſay)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16991:25"/>I truſt ſomething is done euen alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But if neither by prayer, nor by diligent looking into Gods lawe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, as yet thy hard vnbeleeuing heart feeleth no ſorrow, nor lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for thy ſinne: Thirdly, look vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tagge tyed to Gods Law: for to mans law there is a tag tyed, that is, a penalty, and that no ſmall one, but ſuch a one, as cannot but make vs to caſt our curriſh tailes between our legges, if wee beleeue it; for all is in vaine, if wee be faithleſſe, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue before we feele.</p>
            <p>This tagge, is Gods <hi>Malediction</hi> or curſe. <hi>Maledictus omnis</hi> (ſayth it) <hi>qui non permanet in omnibus quae ſeripta ſunt io libro legis, vt faciat eam.</hi> Loe, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is all,</hi> no exception, <hi>all,</hi> ſayth God, <hi>which continueth not in all things</hi> (for hee that is guilty of one, is guilty of the whole, ſayth S. <hi>Iames:</hi>) in all things therefore (ſaith the holy Ghoſt) <hi>which are written in the booke of the Lawe to doe them.</hi> He ſayth not, to heare them, to talke of them, to diſpute of them, but, to do them.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:16991:25"/>
            <p>Who is hee now that doth theſe? <hi>Rara Auis,</hi> few ſuch Byrds; yea, none at all. For all are gone out of the way, though not outwardly by word or deed, yet inwardly at the leaſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, and wanting of that which is required: ſo that a child of one nights age is not pure, but (by reaſon of birth ſinne) in danger of Gods <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:</hi> then much more wee, which alaſſe, haue drunken in iniquity, as it were water, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth: But yet we quake not.</p>
            <p>Tell me now, good brother, why do you ſo lightly conſider Gods curſe, that for your ſinnes paſt you are ſo careleſſe, as though you had made a couenant with death and damnation, as the wicked did in <hi>Eſays</hi> time? what is Gods curſe? At the Popes curſe, with booke, bell, and canlde; O! how trembled we which heard it, although the ſame was not directed vnto vs, but vnto others? For this Gods curſe, which is incomparable, more fell and importable, and is directed to vs; yea, hanging ouer vs, all by reaſon of our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16991:26"/>ſinnes: alas, how careleſſe are wee? O faithleſſe hard hearts! O <hi>Iezabels</hi> gheſts, rocked and layd aſleepe in her bed! O wicked wretches, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into the depth of ſinne doe contemne the ſame! O ſorrowleſſe ſinners, and ſhameleſſe ſhrinking har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots!</p>
            <p>Is not the anger of a King death? and is the anger of the King of all kings, a matter to be ſo lightly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as we do regard it, which for our finnes are ſo wretchleſſe, that wee ſlugge and ſleepe it out? As ware mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away at the heate of the fire (ſayth <hi>Dauid</hi>) ſo doe the wicked pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh at the face or countenance of the Lord.</p>
            <p>If, dearely beloued, his face bee ſo terrible and intolerable for ſinners, and the wicked: what thinke wee his hand is? At the face and appearing of Gods anger, the earth trembleth: but we earth, earth: yea, ſtones, yron, flints, tremble nothing at all. If we will not tremble in hearing, woe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, for then ſhall we bee craſhed in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16991:26"/>pieces in feeling. If a Lyon roare, the Beaſts quake: but wee are worſe then beaſts, which quake nothing at the roaring of the Lyon, I meane the Lord of Hoſts. And why? becauſe the curſe of God, hardneſſe of heart, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fallen vpon vs, or elſe we could not but lament and tremble for our ſins: If not for the ſhame and foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof; yet, at the leaſt, for the <hi>malediction</hi> and curſe of God, which hangeth ouer vs for our ſins.</p>
            <p>Lord be mercifull vnto vs for thy Chriſts ſake, and ſpare vs in thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, remember thy mercy towards vs <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the third thing, to the mooning of vs to ſorrow for our ſinnes: that is, for the tagge tyed to Gods Law, I meane, for the <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> and curſe of God. But if our hearts be ſo hard, that through theſe, we yet feele no hearty ſorrow for our ſinnes: let vs fourthly ſet before vs, examples paſt and preſent, olde and new; thereby the holy Spirit may be effectuall, to worke in his time this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16991:27"/>worke of ſorrowing for our ſinne.</p>

            <p>And here, with me, a little look on

You all know, he was but a child in yéeres, defiled he was not with notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: Defiled, ſayd I; nay rather, adorned with ſo many good gifts, and wonderful qualities, as neuer Prince was from the beginning of the world. Should I ſpeake of his wiſedome, of his ripeneſſe in iudgement, of his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of his godly zeale, heroicall heart, Fatherly care for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Nurcely ſolicitude for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo many things are to be ſpoken in commendation of Gods exceeding graces in this Child: that, as <hi>Saluſt</hi> writeth of <hi>Carthage;</hi> I had rather ſpeake nothing, then too little, in that too much is too little.</p>

               </gap> alſo the mind of our King, by a long ſickneſſe, and at length hath taken him away by death; death, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell death, fearefull death. O, if Gods iudgement be begun on him, which as he was the chiefeſt, ſo I thinke the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt, and godlyeſt in the Realme of England, (alas) what will it be on vs, whoſe ſinnes haue ouergrowen ſo our heads, that they are climed vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? I pray you (my good brethren) know, that Gods anger towards vs for our ſins, cannot but be great: yea, too fell, in that we ſée it was ſo great, that our good King could not beare it. What befell <hi>Iewry,</hi> after the death of <hi>Ioſias?</hi> Lord ſaue England, and giue vs repentance: my heart will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to tarry longer herein: I hope this will cauſe ſome repentance.</p>
            <p>If therefore the prayer for Gods feare, the looking in Gods glaſſe, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16991:30"/>the tag thereto will not burſt open the blockiſh heart, yet hope I, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of theſe examples; eſpecially of our late King, and this troubleſom time, will moue ſome teares out of thine heart, if thou wilt pray for Gods Spirit accordingly. For who art thou (thinke alwaies with thy ſelfe) that God ſhould ſpare thée, more then them whoſe examples thou haſt heard? What friends haſt thou? Were not of theſe Kings, Prophets, Apoſtles, learned, and come of holy Stockes? I deceiue my ſelfe (thinke thou with thy ſelfe) if I beléeue that God, being the ſame God that he was, will ſpare me; whoſe wickedneſſe is no leſſe, but much more then ſome of theirs. Hee hateth ſinne now as much as euer hee did. The longer he ſpareth, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vengeance will fall: the deeper he draweth his Bow, the ſorer will his ſhaft pierce.</p>
            <p>But if yet thy heart be ſo harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that all this will not moue thee; then ſurely art thou in a very euill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and remedy now I know none.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16991:31"/>What, ſayd I, none? Know I none? Yes, there is one, which is ſureſby, as they ſay, to ſerue, if any thing will ſerue. You looke to know what this is: Forſooth, the Paſſion, and Death, of <hi>IESVS CHRIST.</hi> You know, the cauſe why <hi>CHRIST</hi> became man, and ſuffered as hee ſuffered, was the ſinnes of his people, that hee might ſaue them from the ſame.</p>
            <p>Conſider the greatneſſe of the ſore, I meane ſin, by the greatneſſe of the Chyrurgion, and the ſalue. Who was the Chyrurgion? no Angel, no Saint, no Archangel, no power, no creature in heauen nor in earth: but onely he, by whom all things were made, all things are ruled alſo; euen Gods own Deareling, and only beloued Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming man.</p>
            <p>Oh what a great thing is this, that could not be done by the Angels, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, Potentates, Powers, or all the creatures of God, without his owne Sonne? who of neceſſity muſt come downe from heauen, to take our nature, &amp; become man. Here haue ye
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16991:31"/>the Shyrurgion: great was the cure, that this mighty Lord tooke in hand.</p>
            <p>Now, what was the ſalue? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, of an ineſtimable valew, and of many compoſitions: I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite al, but rather muſt leaue it to your hearty conſiberations. Thirty-three yeares was he curing our ſore: Hee ſought it earneſtly, by faſting, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying, &amp;c. The ſame night that he was betrayed, I read how buſie he was about a plaiſter in the Garden, when he lying flat on the ground, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with teares, and that of bloud not a few, but ſo many as did flow downe on the ground againe; crying on this ſort: <hi>Father</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>if it bee poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let this Cup depart from me.</hi> That is, If it be poſſible, that elſe the ſinnes of mankind can be taken away: grant that it may be ſo. Thou heardeſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> crying for the Idolaters: Thou heardeſt <hi>Lot</hi> for the <hi>Zoarites: Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Dauid,</hi> and many other for the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites:</hi> And, deere Father, I onely am thine owne Sonne, as thou haſt ſayd, in whom thou art well pleaſed:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16991:32"/>wilt thou not heare me? I haue by the ſpace of thirty-three yeares, done alwaies thy Will: I haue ſo humbled my ſelfe, that I would become an ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect amongſt men, to obey thee.

But yet (ſayth he) <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Syr, what heard he? Though he ſweat bloud and water, in making his plaiſter for our ſore of ſinne, yet it framed not. Twice he cryed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort; yea, though to comfort him God ſent an Angell, wee know, that yet this plaiſter was not allowed for ſufficient, vntill hereunto, Chriſt Ieſus was betrayed, forſaken of all his Diſciples, forſworne of his deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued, bound like a Thiefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed on, buffeted, whipped, ſcourged, crowned with thorns, crucified, rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nailed, hanged vp betweene two theeues, curſed and railed vpon, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in miſery, and had giuen vp the gho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But here thou muſt know, that there are two kinds of promiſes: one, which is properly of the Lawe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Goſpell. In the promiſes of the Law, we may indeed behold
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16991:35"/>Gods mercie, but ſo, that it hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon the condition of our worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as, if thou loue the Lord with all thy heart, &amp;c. thou ſhalt finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. This kinde of promiſe, though it declare vnto vs Gods loue, which promiſeth where he néedeth not: yet vnto him that féeleth not Chriſt, which is the end of the Law, they are ſo farre frnm comforting, that vtterly with the Law they bring man to great deſpaire: ſo greatly we are corrupt, for none ſo loueth God as he ought to doe. From theſe therfore get thee to the other promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, in which we may ſee ſuch plenty and franke liberality of Gods goodnes, that we cannot but be much comforted though we haue very deeply ſinned. For theſe promiſes of the Goſpell doe not hang on the condition of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, as the promiſes of the Law do: but they depend and hang on Gods truth, that as God is true, ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be performed to al them which lay hold on them by faith; I had almoſt ſaid, which caſt them not away by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:16991:36"/>
            <p>Marke in them therefore two things; namely, that as well they are free promiſes, without any condition of our worthineſſe: as alſo, that they are vniuerſall offered to all, all (I ſay) which are not ſo ſtubborne, as to kéepe ſtill their hands, whereby they ſhould receiue this almes in their boſoms, by vnbeliefe. As concerning Infants and children, you know I now ſpeak not; but concerning ſuch as be of years of diſcretion. And now you looke that I ſhould giue you a taſte of theſe promiſes, which are both frée and vniuerſall: except none but ſuch as except themſelues. Well, you ſhall haue one or two for a ſay.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>3.</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith our Sauiour: <hi>So God the Father loued the world, that he would giue his Dearling, his own only Sonne, that al that beleeue in him ſhould not periſh, but haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Loe, ſir, he ſaith not, that ſome might haue life: but all, ſaith he. And what all? All that loue him with all their hearts? all that haue liued a godly life? Nay, all that beléeue in him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16991:36"/>Althogh thou haſt liued a moſt wicked and horible life: if now thou beleeue in him, thou ſhalt be ſaued. Is not this ſweet grace?</p>
            <p>Againe, ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Come vnto me, all yee that labour and are laden, and I will refreſh you.</hi> Let vs a litle looke one this letter: <hi>Come vnto me:</hi> Who ſhould come? Lords, Prieſts, Holy men, Monkes, Friers? Yea, Coblers, tinkers, whores, theeues, murtherers alſo, if they lament their ſinnes. <hi>Come vnto me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all ye that labour and are laden;</hi> that is, which are afrayd of your ſinnes. And what wilt thou do, Lord? <hi>And I will refreſh you</hi> (ſaith he.)</p>
            <p>Oh what a thing is this: <hi>And I will refreſh you?</hi> Wot you who ſpake this? He that neuer told lye: He is the truth, there was neuer guile found in his mouth: and now wil he be vntrue to thee (good brother) which art ſorie for thy grieuous ſinnes? No forſooth: heauen and earth ſhal paſſe and periſh, but his word ſhall neuer fayle.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>God would haue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16991:37"/>all men ſaued:</hi> Loe, he excepteth none. And to <hi>Titus: The grace of God brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſaluation to all men.</hi> As from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> all haue recieued ſin to damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo by Chriſt, all haue grace offered to ſaluation, if they reiect not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. I ſpeak not now of Infants, I ſay: nor I neede not enter into the matter of Predeſtination. In preaching of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, I would gather where I could with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As ſurely as I liue,</hi> (ſayth God) <hi>I wil not the death of a ſinner.</hi> Art thou a ſinner? Yea: Loe, God ſweareth, he will not thy death. How canſt thou now periſh? Conſider with thy ſelfe, what profit thou ſhouldſt haue, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this to be true to others, if not, to thy ſelfe alſo: Sathan doth ſo. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider with <hi>Peter,</hi> that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſaluation pertaineth not only to them which are nie; that is, to ſuch as are fallen a little: but alſo to all, to whom the Lord hath called, bee they neuer ſo farre off.</p>
            <p>Loe, now by mee, the Lord calleth thee, thou man, thou woman, that art
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16991:37"/>very farre off. The promiſe therefore pertaineth to thee: needs muſt thou be ſaued, except thou with Sathan ſay, God is falſe: And if thou do ſo, God is faithful, &amp; cannot deny himſelfe: as thou ſhalt feele by his plagues in hell, for ſo diſhonouring God, to think that he is not true. Will he be found falſe now? The matter hangeth not on thy worthineſſe, but it hangeth on Gods truth. Clap hold on it, and I warrant thee, <hi>CHRIST</hi> is the propitiation for our ſins; yea for the ſins of the whole world: beleeue this, man: I know thou beleeueſt it: ſay therefore in thy heart ſtill: <hi>Domine audage mihi fidem: <hi>Lord encreaſe my faith: Lord help my vnbeliefe.</hi>
               </hi> Bleſſed are they which ſee not (by reaſon) this but yet beleeue: Beloued, wee muſt hope aboue hope, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And thus much for a taſte of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which are euery where, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the new Teſtament, but alſo in the Old. Reade the laſt end of <hi>Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus 26.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Eſay 30.</hi> Where he ſaith: <hi>God tarrieth looking
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16991:38"/>for thee to ſhew thee mercy.</hi> Alſo the <hi>40.</hi> and ſo forth to the <hi>60.</hi> Reade alſo <hi>2. Kings 24. Pſal. 33. Ioel 2. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit, if all this will not ſerue, if yet thou féeleſt no faith, no certaine perſwaſion of Gods loue: then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy ſelfe vnto praier, and diligent conſidering of the frée and vniuerſall promiſes of the Goſpell: Thirdly, ſet before thée thoſe bleſſings which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and at that preſent, God hath giuen thée. Conſider, how hee hath made thée a man or a woman, which might haue made thée a Toade, or a Dog. And why did he this? Verily, becauſe he loued thée: And thinkeſt thou, if hee loued thée when thou waſt not, to make thée ſuch a one, as he moſt graciouſly hath: will he not now loue thee, being his handy worke? Doth he hate any thing that he made? Is there vnableneſſe with him? Doth he loue for a day, and ſo farewell? No, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, God loueth to the end, his mercy endureth for euer. Say therfore with <hi>Iob. <hi>Operi manuum tuarum, porrige dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram,</hi>
               </hi> that is: <hi>To the worke of thy
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16991:38"/>hands, put thy helping hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, hath hee not made thee a Chriſtian man or woman, where if he would, hee might haue made thee a <hi>Turke</hi> or <hi>Pagan?</hi> This thou know'ſt he did of loue. And dooſt thou thinke his loue is leſſened, if thou lament thy ſin? Is his hand ſhortned for helping thee? Can a woman forget the child of her wombe? and though ſhe ſhould, yet will not I forget thee, ſaith the Lord. Hee hath giuen thee limbes, to ſee, heare, go, &amp;c. He hath giuen thee wit, reaſon, diſcretion, &amp;c. Hee hath long ſpared thee, and born with thee, when thou neuer purpoſedſt to repent: and now thou repenting, will he not giue thee mercy? Wherfore doth he grant thee to liue at this preſent, to heare him to ſpeake this, and mee to ſpeake this but of loue to vs all? Oh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs pray him, that he would add to this, that wee might beleeue theſe loue tokens, that he loueth vs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he will do it. Lord open our eies in thy gifts, to ſee thy gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:16991:39"/>
            <p>But to tarry in this I will not. Let euery man conſider Gods benefites, paſt and preſent, publike and priuate, ſpirituall and corporall, to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his faith, concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel, for the pardon of his ſinnes.</p>
            <p>I will now go about to ſhew you a fourth meane to confirme your faith in this, euen by examples. Of theſe there are in the Scriptures very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; as alſo daily experience doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly teach the ſame, if we were dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to obſerue things accordingly: wherfore, I will be more briefe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hauing reſpect to time, which ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth faſt away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe tranſgreſſed grieuouſly, as the painefull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we all as yet féele, proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, if nothing elſe. Though by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſin, he diſpleaſed God ſore, and ran away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, (for he would haue hid himſelfe; yea, he would haue made God the cauſer of his ſin, in that he gaue him ſuch a Mate, ſo far was he from aſking mercy): yet all this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16991:39"/>notwithſtanding, GOD turned his fierce wrath, neither vpon him nor <hi>Eue,</hi> which alſo required not mercy; but vpon the Serpent Sathan: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing vnto them a ſéed, Ieſus Chriſt; by whom, they at the length ſhould be deliuered. In token whereof, though they were caſt out of Paradiſe for their nurture, to ſerue in ſorrow, which would not ſerue in ioy; yet hée made them apparell to couer their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes: a viſible Sacrament, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his inuiſible loue and grace, concerning their ſoules. If God was ſo mercifull to <hi>Adam,</hi> which ſo ſore brake his commandement, and rather blamed God then aſked mercy: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou, O man, that he will not bee mercifull to thée, which blameſt thy ſelfe, and deſireſt pardon?</p>
            <p>To <hi>Cain</hi> hee offered mercy, if hee would haue aſked it. <hi>What haſt thou done,</hi> ſaith God? <hi>The voice of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bloud, cryeth vnto me out of the earth.</hi> O merciful Lord (ſhould <hi>Cain</hi> haue ſayd) I confeſſe it: But alas, he did not ſo, and therefore, ſaid God:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16991:40"/>
               <hi>Now,</hi> that is, In that thou deſireſt not mercy: <hi>Now:</hi> I ſay, <hi>be thou accurſed, &amp;c.</hi> Loe, to the reprobate he offered mercy, and will he deny it thee, which art his child?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noah,</hi> did he not ſin and was drunk? Good <hi>Lot</hi> alſo, both in <hi>Sodome</hi> diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a little with the Angels, prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time: and out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> he fel very foule: as did <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks againſt <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> but yet I ween they found mercy. <hi>Moſes, Myriam, Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> though they ſtumbled a little, yet receiued they mercy: yea, the people in the wildernes often ſinned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed God, ſo that he was purpoſed to haue deſtroyed them. Let me alone (ſaith he to <hi>Moſes</hi>) that I may deſtroy them. But <hi>Moſes</hi> did not let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for he prayed ſtill for them, and therfore God ſpared them. If the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſpared, through <hi>Moſes</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they not praying with him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſhipping their golden Calfe, eating, drinking, and making iolly good cheere: Beloued, why ſhouldeſt thou doubt whether GOD will bee
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16991:40"/>mercifull to thee? hauing, as indeede thou haſt, one much better then <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for thee, and with thee; euen Ieſus Chriſt, who ſitteth on the right hand of his Father, and prayeth for vs, being no leſſe faithfull in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, the Church, then <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the Synagogue. <hi>Dauid,</hi> that good King, had a foule foile, when hee committed whoredom with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants wife, <hi>Bethſheba:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he added alſo a miſchieuous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cauſing her huſband, his moſt faithfull Souldier <hi>Vria</hi> to bee ſlaine, with an honeſt company of his moſt valiant men of warre, and that with the ſword of the vncircumciſed.</p>
            <p>In this ſinne, though a great while he lay aſleep (as many do now a dayes, God giue them good waking) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that by the Sacrifices he offered, all was well, God was content: yet at length, when the Prophet, by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, opened the offence, and brought <hi>Dauid</hi> in remembrance of his owne ſin, &amp; in ſuch ſort, that he gaue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt himſelfe: then quaked
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16991:41"/>he, his Sacrifices had no more taken away his ſinnes, then our Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> Trentals, and wagging of his fingers ouer the heads of ſuch as lye aſleep in their ſinnes (out of the which when they are awaked, they will ſee, that it is neither Maſſe nor Mattins, bleſſing nor curſing will ſerue) then, I ſay, he cryed out, ſaying: <hi>Peccaui Domine: <hi>I haue ſinned,</hi>
               </hi> ſayth hee, <hi>againſt my Lord and good God,</hi> which hath done ſo much for me. I cauſed indeed <hi>Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> to be killed, I haue ſinned, I haue ſinned. What ſhall I do? I haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and am worthy of eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But what ſayth God, by his Prophet: <hi>Dominus</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>tranſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit peccatum tuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, non morieris: <hi>The Lord hath taken away thy ſinnes, thou ſhalt not dye.</hi>
               </hi> Oh good God, hee ſayd, but <hi>Peccaui, <hi>I haue ſinned:</hi>
               </hi> but yet fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his heart, and not from the lips only, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> &amp; <hi>Saul</hi> did, and incontinently he heareth: <hi>Thou ſhalt not dye, the Lord hath taken away thy ſinnes:</hi> Or rather, hath layd them vpon an other; yea, tranſlated them vpon the backe of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16991:41"/>his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, who bare them, and not onely them, but thine and mine alſo, if that we will now cry but from our hearts, <hi>Peccauimus: <hi>We haue ſinned,</hi>
               </hi> good Lord, we haue done wickedly; enter not into iudgement with vs, but be merciful vnto vs after thy great mercie, and according to the multitude of thy compaſſions, do away our iniquities, &amp;c. For indeede, God is not the God of <hi>Dauid</hi> onely: <hi>Idem Deus omnium, <hi>Hee is the God of all:</hi>
               </hi> So that, <hi>Quicunque inuocauerit nomen Domini, ſalus erit. <hi>He or ſhee, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they bee that call vpon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaued.</hi>
               </hi> In confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof, this Hiſtory is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as are alſo the other wich I haue recited, and many mo which I might recite. As of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> the wicked King, which ſlew <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet, and wrought very much wickedneſſe; yet the Lord ſhewed mercy vpon him being in priſon, as his Prayer doth teach vs. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> though for a time he bare Gods anger, yet at the length he found mercy.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:16991:42"/>
            <p>The City of <hi>Niniuie</hi> alſo found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God, as did many other, which for breuity I will omit, and wil bring forth one or two out of the new Teſtament, that we may ſee God to be the ſame God in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he was in the old.</p>
            <p>I might tell you of many, if I ſhould ſpeak of the Lunatike, ſuch as were poſſeſſed with Diuels, Lame, Blind, Dumbe, Deafe, Lepers, &amp;c. But time wil not ſuffer me; therfore, one or two ſhall ſerue. <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> had ſeuen diuels, but yet they were caſt out of her: and of all others, ſhee was the firſt that Chriſt appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, after his reſurrection. <hi>Thomas</hi> would not beleeue Chriſts reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though many told him, which had ſeene and felt him: by reaſon wherof, a man might haue thought that his ſinnes would haue caſt him away. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I ſhould ſee and feele</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I will not beleeue.</hi> Ah wilfull <hi>Thomas:</hi> I wil not, ſaith he. But Chriſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, and would not leeſe him, neither will he thee, beloued, if
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16991:42"/>with <hi>Thomas,</hi> thou wilt keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the Diſciples, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did. <hi>Peters</hi> fall was vgly, he accurſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if euer he knew Chriſt, and that for feare of a Mayden, and this not once, but three ſeueral times, and that in the hearing of Chriſt his Maſter: but yet the third time Chriſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked backe, and caſt on him his eye of grace, ſo that hee went out and wept bitterly. And after Chriſts reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only did the Angels will the woman to tell <hi>Peter,</hi> that Chriſt was riſen, but Chriſt himſelfe appeared vnto him ſeuerally: ſuch a good Lord is he.</p>
            <p>The Thief hanging on the Croſſe, ſayd but this: <hi>Lord, when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt into thy Kingdome, remember me:</hi> And what anſwere had he? <hi>This day</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> What a comfort is this, in that he is now the ſame Chriſt to thee and me, and to vs all, if wee will runne vnto him? for hee is the ſame Chriſt to day and to morrow, vntill he come to iudgement.

            <p>Thus haue you foure meanes, which you muſt vſe to the attayning of faith, or certaine perſwaſion of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards you, which is the ſecond part of penance; namely, prayer, the free and vniuerſall promiſes of Gods graces, the recordation of the benefits of God, paſt and preſent, the examples of Gods mercie. Which although they might ſuffice, yet will I put one more to them, which all onely of it ſelfe, is full ſufficient: I meane, the death of the Son of God, Ieſus Chriſt: which if thou ſet before the eys of thy minde, it will confirm thy aſſurance: for it is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16991:44"/>the great Seale of England, as they ſay; yea, of all the world, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of al Patents and perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the euerlaſting life, whereunto we are all called.</p>
            <p>If I thought theſe, which I haue before recited, were not ſufficient to confirme your faith of Gods loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch as do repent, I would ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie longer herein. But becauſe I haue béene both long, and alſo I truſt, you haue ſome exerciſe of concience in this daily (or els you are to bſame) I wil but touch and goe, Conſider with your ſelues what we are miſers, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and enimies to God. Conſider what God is, euen he, which hath all power, maieſtie, might glory, riches &amp;c. perfectly of himſelfe, and needeth nothing, but hath all things. Conſider what Chriſt is: concerning his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, coequal with his Father, euen he by whom all things were made; he, I ſay, by whome all things are ruled and gouerned: Concerning his Manhood, the onely Dearling of his Father, in whome is all his ioy.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16991:45"/>Now Sir, what a loue is this? that this God which néedeth nothing, would giue wholy his owne ſelfe to thée, his enemy, wreaking his wrath vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelf, in this his Son: as a man may ſay, to ſpare thee, to ſaue thée, to win thée, to buye thee, to haue thee, to enioy thee for euer. Becauſe thy ſin hath ſeperated thee from him, to the end thou mighteſt come eftſoones into his company again, &amp; therin remain; hee himſelfe became, as a man would ſay, a ſinner: or rather ſinne it ſelfe, euen a malediction or curſe: that wee ſinners, wee accurſed by our ſinne, might by his oblation or ſuffering for our ſinnes, by his curſe, be deliuered from ſinne and from malediction. For by ſinne, he deſtroyed ſinne, killing Death, Sathan, and Sinne, by their owne weapons; and that for thee and mee (man) if wee caſt it not away bp vnbeleefe. Oh wonderfull loue of God. Who euer heard of ſuch a loue? the Father of Heauen for vs his enemies, to giue his owne dearely beloued Sonne, Ieſus Chriſt, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16991:45"/>that not onely to be our Brother, to dwell among vs: but alſo, to the death of the Croſſe for vs? Oh won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull loue of Chriſt to vs all, that was content and willing to worke this deede for vs. Was there any loue like to this loue?</p>
            <p>God indeede hath commanded his charitie and loue to vs herein, that when wee were very enemies vnto him, he would giue his owne Sonne for vs. That wee being men, might become, as you would ſay, Gods; God would become man. That we being mortall, might become immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, the immortall God would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mortall man. That we earthly weretches might be Citizens of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Lord of Heauen would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as a man would ſay, earthly. That we being accurſed, might be bleſſed, God would be accurſed. That we, by our father <hi>Adam,</hi> being broght out of Paradiſe, into the puddle of al pain, might be redeemed, and brought into Paradiſe againe, God would be our Father and an <hi>Adam,</hi> thereunto.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:16991:46"/>
            <p>That wée hauing nothing, might haue al things; God hauing al things, would haue nothing. That we being vaſſailes, and ſlaues to all, euen to Sathan the Fiend, might be Lords of all, and of Sathan: the Lord of all would become a vaſſaile, and a ſlaue to vs all, and in danger of Sathan. Oh loue incomprehenſible. Who can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe thinke now, but if the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious good Lord diſdained not to giue his owne Sonne, his owne hearts ioy for vs his very enemies, before wée thought to begge any ſuch thing at his hands; yea, before we were? who, I ſay, can thinke otherwiſe, but that with him, hee will giue vs all good things? If when we hated him, and fled away from him, hee ſent his Son to ſéek vs: who can thinke otherwiſe, then that now we louing him, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, becauſe wee loue him no more, but that he wil foreuer loue vs? Hee that giueth the more to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, will not he giue the leſſe to his friends? God hath giuen his owne Sonne, then which nothing is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16991:46"/>euen to vs his enemies: and wée now being become his friends, wil ne deny vs faith and pardon of our ſins? which though they be great, yet in compariſon they are nothing at all. Chriſt Ieſus would giue his owne ſelfe for vs, when we willed if not: and will he now deny vs faith, if wee will it? This will is his earneſt, that he hath giuen vs truly to looke indeed, for the thing willed. And looke thou for it in deed: for as he hath giuen thée to will, ſo will he giue thee to doe.</p>
            <p>Ieſus Chriſt gaue his life for our euils, and by his death hee deliuered vs. O then, in that hee liueth now, and cannot dye, will hee forſake vs? his heart bloud was not too deare for vs, when we aſked it not: what can then be now too deare for vs, aſking it? Is he a changeling? Is he muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as man is? Can he repent him of his gifts? Did he not foreſée our falls? Payd not he therefore the price? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſawe wee ſhould fall ſore, therefore would he ſuffer ſore. Yea, if his ſuffering had not béene enough,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16991:47"/>he would yet once more come againe. God the Father, I am ſure, if the death of his Sonne incarnate, would not ſerue, would himſelfe and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt alſo become incarnate, and dye for vs.</p>
            <p>This death of Chriſt therefore look on, as the very pledge of Gods loue towards thee, whoſoeuer thou art, how déep ſoeuer thou haſt ſinned. Sée, Gods hands are nayled, they cannot ſtrike thee: his féete alſo, hée cannot run from thée: his armes are wide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to embrace thee: his head hangs downe to kiſſe thée: his very heart is open, ſo that therin look; nay euen ſpy, and thou ſhalt ſée nothing therein, but loue, loue, loue, loue to thee: hide thee therefore, lay thy head there with the Euangeliſt.</p>
            <p>This is the clift of the Rock, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Helias</hi> ſtood. This is for all aking heads a pillow of downe.</p>
            <p>Anoint thy head with this oyle, let this oyntment enbalme thy head, and waſh thy face.</p>
            <p>Tarry thou on this firme Rocke,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16991:47"/>and Ile warrant thee. Say with <hi>Paul, What can ſeparate me from the loue of God?</hi> Can death, can pouertie, can ſickneſſe, hunger, or any miſery, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee now that God loueth thee not? Nay, nothing can ſeparate thee from the loue, wherwith God hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee in <hi>CHRIST IESVS:</hi> whom he loueth, he loueth to the end. So that now where abundance of ſin hath bin in thee, the more is the aboundance of grace. But to what end? Certainly, that as ſinne hath reigned to death, as thou ſeeſt, to the killing of Gods Son: ſo now Grace muſt reigne to Life, to the honouring of Gods Son, who is now aliue, and cannot dye any more.</p>
            <p>So that they which by faith feele this, cannot any more dye to God, but to ſin whereto they are dead and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Chriſt therefore liueth, ſo doe they, and that to God, to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe. The life which they liue, is, <hi>In fide Filij Dei: <hi>In the faith of the Sonne of God.</hi>
               </hi> Whereby you ſee that now I am ſlipt into that,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16991:48"/>which I made the third part of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: namely, newneſſe of life, which I could not ſo haue done, if that it were a part of it ſelfe indeed, as it is an effect or fruit of the ſecond part; that is, of faith, or truſt in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. For he that beléeueth, that is, is certainely perſwaded, ſin to be ſuch a thing, that is the cauſe of all miſerie, and of it ſelfe ſo greatly angreth God, that in heauen nor in earth, nothing could appeaſe his wrath; ſaue alone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the death and precious bloud-ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Sonne of God, in whom is all the delight and pleaſure of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: hee, I ſay, that is perſwaded thus of his ſin; the ſame cannot but in heart abhorre and quake, to doe or ſay; yea, to thinke any thing willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which Gods Lawe teacheth him to be ſinne.</p>
            <p>Againe, he that beleeueth, that is, is certainly perſwaded, Gods loue to be ſo much towards him, that where through ſinne he was loſt, and made a fire brand of hell; the eternall Father of mercy, which is the omni ſufficient
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16991:48"/>God, and néedeth nothing to vs, or of any thing that we can do, to deliuer vs out of hell, and to bring vs into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; did ſend euen his owne moſt deer Sonne out of his boſome, out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into hell (as a man would ſay) to bring vs, as I ſayd, from thence into his own boſome and mercy, we being his very enemies: hee I ſay, that is thus perſwaded of Gods loue toward him, and of the price of his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the deare bloud of the Lamb immaculate, <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> the ſame man cannot but loue God again; and of loue doe that, and heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to doe better, the which might pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Thinke you, that ſuch a one, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things by faith, wil willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſt &amp; wallow in his wilfull luſts, pleaſures, and fantaſies? Will ſuch a one, as knoweth by faith, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to haue giuen his bloud to waſh him from his ſins, play the Sow to nuzle in his puddle of filthy ſin and vice againe? Nay, rather then hee will bee defiled againe by his wilfull
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16991:49"/>ſinning, he will waſh often the feet of his affections, watching ouer the vice ſtil ſticking in him; which as a ſpring, continually ſendeth out poiſon enogh, to drowne and defile him, if the ſweet water of <hi>CHRISTS</hi> paſſion in Gods ſight, did not waſh it, and his bloud ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie the rigor of Gods iuſtice due for the ſame.</p>
            <p>This bloud of Chriſt ſhed for our ſinnes, is ſo deare in the ſight of him that beleeueth, that he will abhorre in his heart, to ſtamp it, and tread it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet. He knoweth now, by his beliefe, that it is too much, that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he hath ſet too little by it, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed thereof. Therefore for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of his life, he purpoſeth to take better heed to himſelfe, then before he did. Becauſe he ſeeth by his faith, the grieuouſnes of Gods anger, the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, the greatneſſe of Gods mercy, and of Chriſts loue towards him, hee will now bee heedy to pray vnto God to giue him his grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; that as with his eyes, and tongue, hands, &amp; feet, &amp;c. hee hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16991:49"/>God, doing his own wil: euen ſo now with the ſame eyes, tong, &amp;c. he may diſpleaſe his owne ſelfe, and doe Gods will: Willingly, will hee not doe that which might renew the death of the Son of God. He knoweth he hath too much ſinne, vnwillingly in him, ſo that thereto he will not adde willing offences.</p>
            <p>This willing &amp; witting, offending and ſinning, whoſoeuer doth flatter himſelfe therein; doth euidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate and ſhew, that he neuer yet indeed, taſted of Chriſt truly. He was neuer truely perſwaded, or beleeued, how foul a thing ſin is, how grieuous a thing Gods anger is, how ioyfull and precious a thing, Gods mercie in Chriſt is, how exceeding broad, wide, high and deep Chriſts loue is: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance he can talk and preach of faith, but yet truly in part he neuer felt it.</p>
            <p>For if he did once feel this rauiſhing Conſolation indeed, then would he be ſo far from continuing in ſin, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wittingly, that wholly &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily hee would giue ouer himſelfe to

            <p>For as we, being in the ſeruitude of ſin, demonſtrate our ſeruice, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouer our members to the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin, from iniquity to iniquity: euen ſo, we being made free from ſin, by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and endued with Gods Spirit, a Spirit of liberty, muſt needes demonſtrate this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and libertie, by giuing ouer our members to the obedience of the Spirit: by the which we are lead and guided from vertue to vertue, and all kind of holineſſe. As the vnbeleeuers declare their vnbelief, by the working of the euill ſpirit in them, outwardly the fruits of the fleſh: euen ſo the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers declare their faith, by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods Spirit in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fruits of the ſpirit. For as the Diuell is not dead in thoſe which are his, but worketh ſtill to their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: ſo is not God dead in them which be his, but worketh ſtill to their ſaluation. The which working is not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16991:51"/>the cauſe of the one or the other being in any; but onely a demonſtration, a ſigne, a fruit of the ſame: As the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not the cauſe of the Apple tree, out a fruit of it.</p>
            <p>Thus then you ſee briefly, that newneſſe of life, is not in deed a part of penance, but a fruit of it, a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the iuſtifying faith, a ſigne of Gods good Spirit poſſeſſing the heart of the penitent: as the old life is a fruit of impenitency, a demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a lip-faith, or vnbeliefe, a ſigne of Sathans ſpirit, poſſeſſing the heart of the impenitent, which al thoſe be, that be not penitent.</p>
            <p>For meane I know none: He that is not penitent, the ſame is impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: he that is not gouerned by Gods Spirit, the ſame is gouerned by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans ſpirit. For all that be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are gouerned with the Spirit of Chriſt, which ſpirit hath his fruites. All other that be not Chriſts, are the Diuels. He that gathereth not with Chriſt, ſcattereth abroad.</p>
            <p>Therefore, my dearely beloued,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16991:52"/>I beſeech you to conſider this, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not your ſelues. If you bee not Chriſts, then pertain you to the diuel: of which things the fruits of the fleſh doth aſſure you, as whoredome, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, vncleanneſſe, wantonneſſe, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, witchcraft, enuy, ſtrife, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wrath, ſedition, murther, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, gluttony, blaſphemy, ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, idleneſſe, vaine talking, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, &amp;c. If ſuch like fruite as theſe grow out of the trees of your hearts; ſurely, ſurely, the Diuell is at Inne with you, you are his birds: whom when he hath well fed, he will broach you, and eat you, chaw you and champ you, world without end, in eternall woe and miſery. But I am otherwiſe perſwaded of you all. I truſt you bee all <hi>CHRIST IESVS</hi> his people, and his children; yea, and his brethren by faith.</p>
            <p>As ye ſee your ſins in Gods Law, and tremble, and ſigh, ſorrow and ſob for the ſame: euen ſo you ſee his great mercies in his Goſpell and free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, &amp; therfore are glad, merry and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16991:52"/>ioyfull, for that you are accepted into Gods fauour, haue your ſins pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and are endued with the good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, euen the Seale and ſigne, <hi>MANVEL</hi> of your election in Chriſt Ieſus, euen before the beginning of the World.</p>
            <p>The which Spirit, for that hee is the Spirit of life, giuen to you, to worke in you, with you, and by you here in this life ſatiſfaction, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereunto you are called, that yee might bee holy, euen as your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father is holy: I beſeech you al by admonition and warning of you, that you would ſtirre vp the giftes of God, giuen to you generally &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, to the edifying of his Church, that is: I pray you, that you would not moleſt the good Spirit of God, by rebelling againſt it, when it prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and calleth you to goe on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that the which is holy, might yet be more holy, he which is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, might be more righteous; as the euill ſpirit moueth and ſtirreth vp the filthy to be yet more filthy, the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16991:53"/>to be more couetous, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to be more wicked.</p>
            <p>Declare you now your repentance, by workes of repentance. Bring forth fruits, and worthy fruits.</p>
            <p>Let your ſorrowing for your euils, demonſtrate it ſelfe, departing from the euils you haue vſed.</p>
            <p>Let your certaintie of pardon of your ſinnes, through Chriſt, and your ioy in him be demonſtrated, by perſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the good things which Gods word teacheth you. You are now in Chriſt Ieſus, Gods workmanſhip, to doe good works which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you to walke in.</p>
            <p>For the grace of God that bringeth ſaluation vnto all men, hath appeared, and teacheth vs, that we ſhould denie vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and that we ſhould liue ſoberly, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and godly, in this preſent world; looking for that bleſſed hope and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearing of the mighty God, and of our Sauiour, Ieſus Chriſt, which gaue himſelfe for vs, to redeeme vs from all vnrighteouſneſſe, and to

            <p>Againe, <hi>Titus 3.</hi> For we our ſelues alſo were in times paſt vnwiſe, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, deceiued, ſeruing luſts, and diuers pleaſures liuing in maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and enny, full of hate, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another. But after that the kindneſſe and loue of God our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to manward appeared, not by the deeds of righteouſneſſe which wee wrought, but of his mercy hee ſaued vs by the fountaine of the new birth, and with the renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhedde on vs aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, through Ieſus Chriſt our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; that we once iuſtified by his grace, ſhuld be heires of eternal life, through hope. This is a true ſaying. But I wil make an end, for I am too tedious.</p>
            <p>Dearely beloued, repent your ſins: that is, bee ſorrie for that which is paſt, beleeue in Gods mercy for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, how deepely ſoeuer you haue ſinned, and both purpoſe and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peruſe a new life, bringing forth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and true fruites of Repentance.

               <note place="margin">Who did inſtitute this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>For the firſt, Who did inſtitute this Sacrament and Supper. You all doe know, that things are more eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſometime for the dignitie and authority of the perſon, ſometime for the wiſedome of the perſon, ſometime for the power and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the perſon, &amp; ſometime for the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16991:57"/>tender loue &amp; kindnes of the perſon. If néed were, I could by examples ſet forth euery one of theſe, but I hope it is not neceſſary. Now then how can the thing which we be about to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, but be eſteemed of euery one highly, in that the author of it doth want no dignity, no authority, no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, no power, no magnificence, no holineſſe, no tender loue &amp; kindneſſe? but hath all dignity, authoritie, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, magnificence, &amp;c. and all that can be abſolutely wiſhed.</p>
            <p>He is God eternall, coequall, and ſubſtantiall, with the Father, and with the holy Ghoſt, the Image of the ſubſtance of God, the wiſedome of the Father, the brightneſſe of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by whom all things were made, are ruled and gouerned. Hee is the King of all kings, and the Lord of all lords. He is the <hi>Meſſias</hi> of the world, our moſt deare and louing Brother, Sauiour, Mediatour, Aduocate, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour, Huſband, Prieſt. So that the thing which commeth from him, cannot but bee eſteemed, loued, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16991:57"/>embraced, if dignity, authority, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome power, glory, goodneſſe, and mercy like vs. Yea, if any thing that can bee wiſhed, like vs, then cannot this which our Lord did inſtitute, but like vs; and that ſo much the more, by how much it is one of the laſt things which he did inſtitute and conmaund. God open our eies, to ſee theſe things accordingly: ſo ſhall wee come with more reuerence to this Table of the Lord: which thing hee grant for his mercies ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſt, who did inſtitute this Sacrament.</p>

For no leſſe are they effectual to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtatiate the Cup: then their words ſpoken of the bread, are opeartorious and mighty to tranſſubſtantiate the bread.

            <p>Now in the Lords Supper this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is firſt in nouriſhing, that as bread nouriſheth the body; ſo Chriſts body broken, féedeth the ſoule. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in bringing together many into one, that as in the Sacrament, many graines of Corn are made one bread: many Grapes are made one ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour and Wine: ſo the multitude which worthily receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are made one body with Chriſt, and his Church.

            <p>To the things which I haue brought hereforth, to improue tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, I could bring in the Fathers to confirme the ſame, which ſucceeded contnually many hundred yeares after Chriſt. Alſo I could ſhew that Tranſſubſtantiation is but a

Yea, before this doctrine, the Church was nothing ſo endowed with goods, lands, and poſſeſſions as it hath béen ſince. It hath brought no ſmall gaine, no ſmall honour no ſmall eaſe to the Cleargie: and therefore no maruaile though they ſtriue and fight for it.</p>

Onely, for Gods ſake ſee this, that this their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſſubſtantiation is an vntrueth, already I haue proued; and forget not, that it is the whole ſtay of all Popery, and the pillar of their Prieſthood: whereby Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16991:66"/>Sacrifice, Miniſtery, and Truth is letted, yea peruerted, and vtterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne.</p>
            <p>God our Father, in the bloud of his Sonne <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> open the eyes and mindes of all our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, all other that beare the name of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> to ſee to it in time, to Gods glory, and their owne ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to returne to the ſecond mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what the Sacrament is; you ſee that to the ſenſes and reaſon of man, it is bread and wine: Which is moſt true, as by the Scriptures, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I haue already proued: and therefore away with Tranſſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>But here, leſt we ſhould make it no Sacrament, for a Sacrament conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of two things: and leaſt a man ſhould by this gather, that we make it none other thing but bare bread, and a naked ſigne, and ſo rayle at their pleaſure on vs ſaying: How can a man be guilty of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, by vnworthy receiuing it, if it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16991:67"/>bee but bare bread, and ſo forth? For this purpoſe, I will now ſpeake a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more hereabout, by Gods grace, to ſtop your mouthes, and ſo to ſtirre vp your good hearts, more to the worthy eſtimation and preception of this holy myſtery.</p>
            <p>When a louing friend giueth to thée a thing, or ſendeth to thee a token (as for an example, a napkin, or ſuch like) I thinke thou doeſt not as thou ſhouldeſt doe, if that with the thing, thou conſidereſt not the mind of thy frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that ſendeth or giueth the thing; and according thereunto eſtéemeſt and receiueſt it.</p>
            <p>And ſo of this bread, thinke I, that if thou doe not rather conſider the minde of thy louer Chriſt, then the thing which thou ſeeſt: yea, if thou do not altogether conſider Chriſts mind, thou dealeſt vnhoneſtly, and Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petlike with him. For it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Strumpets, to conſider the things giuen and ſent them, rather then the loue and mind of the giuer and ſender: whereas the true louers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16991:67"/>doe not conſider, in any point, the things giuen or ſent, but the minde of the party.</p>
            <p>So we, if we be true louers of Chriſt, muſt not conſider harely the outward thing which we ſée, and our ſenſes perceiue; but rather altogether, wee muſt and ſhould ſée and conſider the minde of Chriſt, and hereafter and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to it, to eſteeme the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p>But how ſhall we know the minde of Chriſt? Surely, as a mans minde is beſt knowne by his word: ſo by Chriſts word ſhal we know his mind.</p>
            <p>Now his words be manifeſt, and moſt plaine: <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is my body:</hi> therefore, accordingly ſhould wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, take, and receiue it. If hee had ſpoken nothing, or if hee had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken doubtfully, then might wee haue been in ſome doubt. But in that hee ſpeaketh ſo plainly, ſaying: <hi>This is my body:</hi> Who can, may, or dare bee ſo bolde as to doubt of it? Hee is the trueth and cannot lye; he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and can do all things: therefore it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16991:68"/>is his body. This I beléeue, this I confeſſe, and pray you all heartily to beware of theſe and ſuch like words, that it is but a ſigne or figure of his body: Except ye will diſcerne betwixt ſignes which ſignifie only, and ſignes which alſo do repreſent, confirme, and ſeale vp (or as a man may ſay) giue with their ſignification. As for an example: An Iuy buſh, is a ſigne of Wine to be ſold: the budding of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> Rodde, did ſignifie <hi>Aarons</hi> Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, allowed of the Lord: the reſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Moſes</hi> Rod, did ſignifie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the children of Iſrael: the ſtones taken out of <hi>Iordan, Gedeons</hi> fléece of woole, &amp;c. Such as theſe, be ſignes ſignificatiue, and ſhew no gift. But in the other ſigns, which ſome cal exhibitiue, is there not only a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the thing, but alſo a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a gift is, in a certaine manner, a giuing alſo: As Baptiſme not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifieth the cleanſing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from ſinne, by the merits of <hi>CHRISTS</hi> bloud, but alſo is a very cleanſing from ſinne. And therefore
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16991:68"/>it was ſayd to <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and waſh away his ſins, and not that he ſhould ariſe and take onely a ſigne of waſhing away his ſinnes. In the Lords Supper, the bread is called a partaking of the Lords body, and not only a bare ſigne of the Lords body. This I ſpeak not, as though the elements of theſe Sacraments (were Tranſſubſtantiate) which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready impugned eyther, as though Chriſts body were in bread or wine, or that they were tyed to the elements otherwiſe then Sacramentally, and ſpiritually, either that the bread and wine may not, and muſt not be called Sacramentall, and externall ſignes: but that they might be diſcerned from ſignificatiue and bare ſignes only, and he taken for ſignes exhibitiue; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentiue. By this meanes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conſcience will call and eſtéeme the bread of the Lord, as the body of Chriſt. For it will neuer eſtéeme the Sacraments of Chriſt, after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior apearance, but after the words of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:16991:69"/>
            <p>Whereof it commeth, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and others, doe ſpeake with ſo ful a mouth, when they ſpeake of the Sacrament: for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect was to Chriſts words. If the Schoole-men which followed had the ſame ſpirit which they had, then wold they neuer haue conſented to Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. For with great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſome of the Fathers doe ſay; that the bread is changed or turned into the body of Chriſt, and the wine into his bloud: meaning it of a muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or change, not corporall, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, figuratine, Sacramentall, or myſticall. For now it is no common bread, nor common wine, beeing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſerue for the food of the ſoul. The Schoole-men haue vnderſtood it, as the Papiſts now ſpeake of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall changing, as though it were no great miracle, that common bread ſhould now be aſſumed into that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that it ſhould bee called Chriſts body, and ſerue for a celeſtiall foode, and be made a Sacrament of his body and bloud.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:16991:69"/>
            <p>As before therefore I haue ſpoken,<note place="margin">Chriſts preſence in the Supper.</note> I would wiſh that this Sacrament ſhould bee eſteemed, and called of vs Chriſtian men, after Chriſts words: namely, the bread Chriſts body, and the wine Chriſts bloud, rather then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. Not that I meane any other preſence of Chriſts body, then a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of grace, a preſeruer to Faith, a preſence ſpiritually: and not corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, really, naturally, and carnally, as the Papiſts doe meane. For in ſuch ſort Chriſts body is onely in heauen, on the right hand of God the Father almighty, whether our faith in the vſe of the Sacrament, aſcendeth and receiueth whole Chriſt accordingly.</p>
            <p>Yea, but one will ſay, that to cal the Sacrament on that ſort,<note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> is to giue an occaſion of Idolatry to the people, which wil take the Sacrament which they ſee ſimply for Chriſts body, as by experience wee are well taught: and therefore it were better to cal it bread, and ſo leſſe harme ſhould be, eſpecially in this age.</p>
            <p>To this obiection I anſwere,<note place="margin">An anſwer.</note> that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16991:70"/>indéed great Idolatry is committed to, and about this Sacrament; and therefore men ought, as much as they can, to avoyd from occaſion or confirming it.</p>
            <p>But in as much as the holy Ghoſt is wiſer then man, and had foreſight of the euils that might be, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, doth call it Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: I thinke we ſhould do euill, if we ſhould take vpon vs to reforme his ſpéech.</p>
            <p>If Miniſters did their dueties in Catechizing, and Preaching, then doubtleſſe, to call the Sacrament Chriſts body, and to eſtéeme it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, could not giue occaſion to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, and confirme it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Woe vnto them that preach not.</p>
            <p>There be two euils about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which to auoyde, the holy Ghoſt hath taught vs. For leaſt we ſhould with the Papiſts, think Chriſts body preſent in, or with the bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, naturally, and corporally, to be receiued w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> our bodily mouth (where
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16991:70"/>there is no other preſence of Chriſts body then ſpirituall, and to the faith) in many places he kéepeth ſtill the name of bread, as in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the tenth and eleuenth Chapters. And leaſt we ſhold make to light of it, making it but a bare ſigne and no better then common bread, the holy Ghoſt calleth it Chriſts body; whoſe ſpéech I wiſh we would follow and that not onely as well to auoyde the euill, which is now a dayes moſt to be feared, concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I meane, of contemning it: as alſo for that no faithfull man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Sacrament to receiue bread ſimply, but rather, yea, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to communicate with Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud. For elſe to eate &amp; drink (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) they haue houſes of their owne.</p>
            <p>The contempt of the Sacrament, in the dayes of King <hi>Edward,</hi> hath cauſed theſe plagues vpon vs preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord bee mercifull vnto vs. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> And thus much for the obiection, of calling the Sacrament by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Chriſts body.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:16991:71"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Another obiection of Chriſts preſence in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</note>What (ſaith one?) to call the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Chriſts body, and to make none other preſence then by grace, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to faith, which is of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, and of things which to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſenſes do not appeare, is to make no preſence at all, or to make him none otherwiſe preſent, then he is in his word when it is preached: and therefore what néede we to receiue the Sacrament, in as much as by this doctrine, a man may receiue him day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the fielde, as well, and as much as in the Church, in the celebration and vſe of the Sacrament?</p>
            <p>So this obiection, I firſt anſwere: that indeede, neither the Scripture, nor Chriſtian Faith, wil giue vs leaue to make any carnall, reall, naturall, corporall, or any ſuch groſſe preſence of Chriſts naturall body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>For it is in Heauen, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens muſt haue it (as ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) till Chriſts comming to iudgment, except wee would denie the humanity of Chriſt, and the verity of mans nature
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16991:71"/>in him. The preſence therefore which we beléeue and confeſſe, is ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as reaſon knoweth not, and the world cannot learne, nor any that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in this matter with other eyes, or heareth with other eares, then with the eares and eyes of the Spirit and of Faith.</p>
            <p>Which Faith, though it be of things hoped for, and ſo of things abſent to the corporall ſenſes, yet this abſence, is not an abſence, indéede, but to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the old man; the nature of Faith, being a poſſeſſion of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for. Therefore, to grant a preſence to Faith, is not to make no preſence at all, but to ſuch as know not Faith: And this the Fathers taught, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt to be preſent by grace, and therefore, not only a ſignification; but alſo an exhibition and giuing of the Grace of CHRISTS body; that is, of life, and of the ſeede of immortality, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> writeth. Wae eate Life, and drinke Life, faith Saint <hi>AVGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINE.</hi>

            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:16991:72"/>
            <p>We féele a preſence of the Lord by Grace, or in Grace, ſaith <hi>Chryſtome:</hi> We receiue the celeſtiall foode, that commeth from aboue, ſaith <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> We receiue the propertie of the naturall coniunction,<note place="margin">Athanaſius Hylarius.</note> and knitting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſaith <hi>Hillarius.</hi> We receiue the nature of the fleſh the bleſſing that giueth life in bread and Wine, ſaith <hi>Cyrillus.</hi>

               <hi>Baſilius</hi> ſaith, that we by the Sacrament receiue the myſticall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of Chriſts, grace, and the very vertue of his very nature.<note place="margin">Ambroſius.</note> 
               <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, that we receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the true body.<note place="margin">Epiphanius.</note> 
               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith, we receiue the body or grace.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16991:72"/>Grace of the holy Ghoſt. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that we receiue grace and veritie, the inuiſible grace and holineſſe of the members of Chriſts body. All the which ſayings of the Fathers, doe confirme this our faith and doctrine of the Sacrament, wee granting in all things héerein vnto them, and they in like manner vnto vs. And therefore, the lying lippes, which both belye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Doctors, as thogh they granted a carnall and reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſts body, naturally and corporally after the Papiſts declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and meaning: and which belie vs alſo, as though we denied all preſence of Chriſt, and ſo made it but a bare ſigne.</p>
            <p>Theſe lying lips the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, if they repent not, and with vs beleeue, and teach the truth, that the Sacrament is the foode of the Soule a matter of faith, and therefore ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and by faith to be talked of and vnderſtanded: which faith they want, and therfore they erre ſo groſſely, in that they would haue ſuch a preſence
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16991:73"/>of Chriſt, as is contrary to all the Scriptures, and to our Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: whereby commeth no ſuch commodity to the receiuer, as by the Spirituall preſence which wee teach, and according to Gods word doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.</p>
            <p>For wee teach theſe benefits to be had by the worthy receiuing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; namely, that wee abide in Chriſt, and Chriſt in vs. Againe, that we obtaine by it a celeſtiall life, or a life with God: moreouer, that by Faith and in Spirit, wee receiue not onely Chriſts body and blood, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo whole Chriſt, God and man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, we grant, that by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiuing of this Sacrament, we receiue remiſſion of our ſinnes, and confirmation of the new Teſtament. Laſt of all, by worthy receiuing, wee get all increaſe of incorporation with Chriſt, and amongſt our ſelues, which be his members: then which things what more can be deſired? Alas, that men conſider nothing at all, how that the coupling of CHRISTS bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16991:73"/>and blood to the Sacrament, is a ſpirituall thing; and therefore there néeds no ſuch carnall preſence as the Papiſts imagine. Who will deny a mans Wife, to be with her Huſband, one body and one fleſh, although he be at <hi>London,</hi> and ſhee at <hi>Yorke?</hi> But the Papiſts are carnall men, guided by carnall reaſon onely, or elſe would they know how that the holy Ghoſt, becauſe of our infirmitie, vſeth meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically the words of abiding, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, eating and drinking of Chriſt, that the vnſpeakeable coniunction of Chriſt with vs, might ſomething bee knowne. God open their eyes to ſee it.</p>
            <p>And thus much for this.</p>
            <p>Now to that part of the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſayth, that wee teach CHRIST to bee no otherwiſe preſent in the Sacrament, then in his word: I would that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectors would well conſider, what a preſence of CHRIST is in his word. I remember that Saint
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16991:74"/>
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth, how that Chriſts body is receiued ſometime viſible, and ſometime inuiſible.</p>
            <p>The viſible receit, he calleth that which is by the Sacrament: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible receite hee calleth that which by the exerciſe of our faith, with our ſelues, we receiue. And ſaint <hi>Hierom</hi> in the third booke vpon <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> affirmeth, that we are fed with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, and we drinke his blood, not only in myſtery, but alſo in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Scripture. Wherin he plainly ſheweth, that the ſame meat is offered in the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures, which is offered in the Sacrament; ſo that no leſſe is Chriſts body and bloud offered by the Scriptures, then by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Vpon the <hi>147.</hi> Pſalme, hee writeth alſo, that though theſe words: <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood:</hi> may bee vnderſtood in myſterie, yet he ſaith, it is more true to take Chriſts body and his blood, for the word of the Scriptures, and the doctrine of God. Yea, vpon the ſame Pſalme he ſaith plainely, that Chriſts
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16991:74"/>fleſh and bloud is powred into our eares, by hearing the word: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great is the perill, if we yeeld to other cogitations whilſt we heare it. And therefore, I thinke, Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith, that it is no leſſe perill to heare Gods word negligently, then ſo to vſe the Sacrament. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may no man gather, that therefore it néedeth not to receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to affirme that a man may as much by himſelfe, meditating the word in the field, receiue Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as in the Church, in the right vſe of the Sacrament. For Chriſt ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nth nothing in vaine, or ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, hee ordaineth nothing whereof wee haue not neede: Although his authority is ſuch, that without any queſtioning, his ordinances are to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>Againe, though in the field a man may receiue Chriſts body by Faith, in the meditation of the word, yet deny I that a man doth ordinarily receiue Chriſts body, by the only meditation of Chriſts death, or hearing of his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16991:75"/>word, with ſo much ſight, and by ſuch ſenſible aſſurance (whereof God knoweth our infirmitie hath no ſmall need) as by the receit of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not that Chriſt is not ſo much preſent in his word preached, as hee is in, or with his Sacrament: but becauſe there are in the perception of the Sacrament, more windowes open for Chriſt to enter into vs, then by his word preached or heard. For there, I meane in the word, he hath an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into our hearts, but onely by the eares, through the voice and ſound of the words: but heerein the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he hath an entrance by all our ſenſes, by our eyes, by our noſe, by our taſte, and by our handling alſo.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Sacrament full well may be called, ſeeable, ſenſible, taſteable, and touchable words. As therefore, when many windowes be opened in an houſe, the more light may come in then when there is but one opened: euen ſo, by the percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments, a Chriſtian mans conſcience hath more helpe to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16991:75"/>receiue Chriſt, then ſimply by the word preached, heard, or meditated.</p>
            <p>And therefore mee thinketh, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle full well calleth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, obſignations, or ſealings of Gods promiſe. Read <hi>Romans</hi> the fourth, of Circumciſion. And thus much for the anſwere of the obiection aforeſayd.</p>
            <p>Now to returne from whence wee came; namely, to the conſideration of the ſecond thing, what the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is: I haue told you, that it is not ſimply Bread and Wine, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſts body, ſo called of Chriſt, and ſo to be called and eſteemed of vs. But heere let vs marke what body, and what blood Chriſt called it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chriſts preſence in the Supper.</note>The Papiſts ſtill babble: <hi>This is my body, This is my blood.</hi> But what body it is, what blood it is, they ſhew not.</p>
            <p>Looke therefore, my dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, on Chriſts owne words, and you ſhall ſee, that CHRIST calleth it his body broken, and his blood ſhedde. Marke, I ſay, tha
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16991:76"/>Chriſt calleth it his body which is broken, his blood which is ſhed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and not which was broken, or ſhall be broken, which was ſhed, or ſhall be ſhed, as the <hi>Greeke</hi> Texts do plainely ſhew: thereby teaching vs, that as God would haue the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer called, not which was the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, or ſhall be the Paſſeouer, but plainely the Paſſeouer; to the end that in the vſe of it, the paſſing ouer of the ſtriking Angell, ſhould be ſet before their eyes as preſent: ſo in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lords Supper, the very Paſſion of Chriſt ſhould be as preſent, beholden with the eyes of Faith.</p>
            <p>For which end, Chriſt our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did ſpecially inſtitute this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſaying: <hi>Doe ye this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of mee:</hi> or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>Shew you the Lords death till he come.</hi>

            <p>The Supper of the Lord then, is not ſimply Chriſts body and blood, but Chriſts body broken, and his blood ſhedde. Wherefore broken? Wherefore ſhedde? Forſooth, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16991:76"/>teacheth Chriſt himſelfe, ſaying: <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you, Shed for your ſinnes, and for the ſins of many.</hi> Here now then we haue occaſion in the vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to call to mind the greatnes and grieuouſneſſe of ſinne, which could not be taken away by any other meanes, then by the ſhedding of the moſt precious bloud, and breaking of the moſt pure body, of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne of GOD, Ieſus Chriſt; by whome all things were made, all things are ruled and gouerned, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Who conſidering this thing, ſhall not be touched to repent? Who in the receiuing of this Sacrament, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt ſaith to him: <hi>Take, eate, this is my body, which is broken for thee: This is my blood which is ſhedde for thy ſinnes,</hi> can but trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the grieuouſneſſe of his ſinnes, for the which ſuch a price was payd? If there were no plague at all elſe, to admoniſh man of ſinne, how grieuous a thing it is in Gods ſight, ſurely that one were enough. But alas, how are our hearts bewitched, through
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16991:77"/>Sathans ſubtilties, and the cuſtome of ſinne, that we make ſinne a thing of nothing? God open our eyes in time, and giue vs repentance, which wee ſée this Sacrament doth, as it were, enforce vs vnto, in the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and true vſe of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Againe, in hearing that this which we take and eate, is Chriſts body bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for our ſinnes, and his bloud ſhed for our iniquities, we are occaſioned to call to mind the infinite greatneſſe of GODS mercy and truth, and of Chriſts loue towards vs. For what a mercie is this, that God would for man, beeing loſt through his wilfull ſinnes, be content; yea, deſirous to giue his owne onely Sonne, <hi>The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his ſubſtance, the brightneſſe of his glorie,</hi> being in his own boſome, to be made man for vs, that we men by him, might be; as it were, made Gods? What a mercie is this, that God the Father ſhould ſo tender vs, that he would make this his Sonne, being equall with him in diuinitie, a mortall man for vs, that wee might
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16991:77"/>bee made immortall by him? What a kindneſſe is this, that the Almighty Lord ſhould ſend to vs his enemies, his deare Darling to bee made poore, that wee by him might bee made rich?</p>
            <p>What bowels of compaſſion was this, that the omnipotent Creator of Heauen and earth, would deliuer his owne onely beloued Sonne for vs creatures, to be not onely fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones, that we might by him through the holy Ghoſt, be made one with him, and ſo with the Father, by communicating the merits of his fleſh; that is, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, holineſſe, innocencie, and immortalitie: but alſo to bee a ſlaine Sacrifice for our ſinnes, to ſatiſfie his iuſtice, to conuert or turne death into life, our ſinne into righteouſnes, hell into Heauen, miſery into felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for vs? What a mercy is this, that GOD will rayſe vp this his Sonne CHRIST, not onely to iuſtifie and regenerate vs? but alſo in his perſon, to demonſtrate
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16991:78"/>vnto vs our ſtate, which wee ſhall haue: for in his comming we ſhall be like vnto him.</p>
            <p>Oh wonderful mercy of God, which would aſſume this his Chriſt, euen in humane body, into the heauens, to taken and kéepe their poſſeſſion for vs, to leade our captiuitie, captiue, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before him alwaies praying for vs, to make the throne of Iuſtice a throne of mercy, the ſeat of glory a ſeat of grace! So that with boldneſſe we may come and appeare before God, to aſke and finde grace, in time conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. Againe, what a verity and conſtant trueth in God, is this, that he would, according to his promiſe, made firſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and others in his time, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, by ſending his ſonne ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly? Who would doubt hereafter, of anything that he hath promiſed?</p>
            <p>And as for Chriſts loue, oh, whoſe heart can be able to thinke of it any thing as if deſerueth? He being God would become man: He being rich would become poore: He being Lord
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16991:78"/>of all the world, became a ſeruant to vs all, hee being immortall, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mortall, miſerable, and taſte of all Gods curſes; yea, euen of hell it ſelfe for vs. His bloud was nothing too deare, his life nothing conſidered, to bring vs from death to life.</p>
            <p>But this his loue néedeth more heartie weighing, then many words ſpeaking: and therefore, I omit and leaue it to your conſiderations. So that in the receiuing of this Supper, as I would you would tremble at Gods wrath for ſin: ſo would I haue you to couple to that terror and feare, true faith, by which ye might be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perſwaded of Gods mercie towards you, and Chriſts loue, though all things elſe preached the contrary.</p>
            <p>Do euery of you ſurely think, when you heare theſe words, <hi>Take eate, this is my body, broken for your ſinnes: Drinke, this is my bloud, ſhed for your ſins:</hi> That God, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternal Father, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing you, Chriſt calleth &amp; clippeth you muſt louingly, making himſelfe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16991:79"/>one with you, and you one with him, and one with another amongſt your ſelues.</p>
            <p>You ought no leſſe to be certaine now that God loueth you, pardoneth your ſinnes, and that Chriſt is all yours, then if you did heare and Angell out of heauen ſpeaking ſo vnto you. And therefore reioyce and be glad, and make this Supper <hi>Eutharichiam,</hi> a thankeſgiuing as the Fathers named it. Be no leſſe certaine, that Chriſt and you now are all one, then you are certaine, the bread and wine is one with your nature and ſubſtance, after you haue eaten and drunke it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, in this it differeth, that you by faith are, as it were, changed into Chriſt, and not Chriſt into you, as the bread is: for by faith he dwelleth in vs, and we in him. God giue vs faith in the vſe of this Sacrament, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Chriſt as he giueth vs hands to receiue the element, ſimbole, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sacrament. God grant vs not to prepare our féeth and belly (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) but rather of his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16991:79"/>mercy, he prepare and giue vs true and liuely faith, to vſe this and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ordinances to his glory and our comforts. He ſweep the houſes of our hearts, and make them cleane, that they may bee worthy Temples and lodgings for the Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</note>Now let vs come and looke on the third and laſt thing; namely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords did inſtitute this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Our nature is very obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of GOD, and of all his benefits And againe, it is very full of dubitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and doubting of GODS loue, and of his kindneſſe. Therefore, to the end theſe two things might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reformed and holpen in vs, the Lord hath inſtituted this Sacrament; I meane, that we might haue in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie the principall benefite of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, that is, Chriſts death, and that we might be on all parts aſſured of Communinon with Chriſt, of al kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the greateſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer God did giue vnto man. The former to be the end, wherfore Chriſt did inſtitute this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, he himſelfe doeth teach vs,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16991:80"/>ſaying: <hi>Doe ye this in remembrance of me.</hi> The latter, the Apoſtle doeth no leſſe ſet forth in ſaying: <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or Communion of the body of Chriſt? Is not the Cuppe of bleſsiing, which we bleſſe, the partaking or Communion of the bloud of Chriſt?</hi> So that it appeareth, the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Sacrament was inſtituted, was and is, for the reformation and helpe of our obliuion, of that which we ſhould neuer forget; and of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of that whereof we ought to be moſt certaine.</p>
            <p>Concerning the former, namely, of the memorie of Chriſts death, what commoditie it bringeth with it, I will purpoſely for times ſake omit. Onely, a little will I ſpeake of the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties comming vnto vs, by the partake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue with Chriſt. Firſt it teacheth vs, that no man can communicate with Chriſt, but the ſame muſt néeds communicate with Gods grace and fauor, where-through ſinnes are forgiuen.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:16991:80"/>
            <p>Therefore, this commodity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth here-through; namely, that we ſhould be certaine of the remiſſion and pardon of our ſinnes. The which thing wee may alſo perceiue by the Cup, in that it is called the Cuppe of the new Teſtament: to which Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is properly attributed, on Gods behalfe, obliuion or remiſſion of our ſinnes. Firſt, I ſay, therefore; the Supper is inſtituted to this end, that hee which worthily receiueth, ſhould bee certaine of the remiſſion and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his ſinnes and iniquities, how many and great ſoeuer they be. How great a benefit this is, only they know which haue felt the burthen of ſinne, which of all heauy things, is the moſt heauy. Againe, no man can commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with Chriſts body and bloud, but the ſame muſt communicate with his ſpirit, for Chriſts body is no dead carkaſſe. Now he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> communicateth with Chriſts Spirit, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth as with holines, righteouſnes, innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and immortality, and with all the merits of Chriſts body: ſo doth hee
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16991:81"/>with God and all his glory, and with the Church, and all the good that euer it or any member of it had, hath, or ſhall haue:<note place="margin">Note though I apply this thus: yet I would not that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſhould think, that <hi>Communio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> in the Creed, is not ſet forth there for the better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth it namely, what the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church is.</note> This is, <hi>The communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints,</hi> which we beleeue in our Creede, which hath wayting on it, Remiſſion of ſinnes, Reſurrection of the fleſh, and life euerlaſting.</p>
            <p>To the end, that we ſhould be moſt aſſured &amp; certain of al theſe, Chriſt our Sauiour did inſtitute this his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and therefore would haue vs to vſe it. So that there is no man; I thinke, which ſeeeth not great cauſe of giuing thanks to God, for this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament of the Lord, whereby if we worthily receiue it, wee ought to bee certaine, that all our ſinnes whatſoeuer they bee, are pardoned cleerely: that we are regenerate and borne againe into a liuely hope, into an inheritance, immortall, vndefiled, and which can neuer wither away: that wee are in the fellowſhip of God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt: that we are Gods Temples, at one with God, and GOD at one
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16991:81"/>with vs: that wee are members of <hi>CHRISTS</hi> Church, and fellowes with the Saints in all felicitie: that wee are certaine of immortalitie, in ſoule and body, and ſo of eternall life: then which thing, what can bee more demanded? <hi>CHRIST</hi> is ours, and wee are Chriſts, hee dwelleth in vs, and we in him. Oh happy eyes that ſee theſe thinges! And moſt happy hearts that féele them. My deare brethren, let vs pray vnto the Lord, to open our eyes to ſee theſe wonderfull things, to giue vs faith to feele them. Surely wee ought no leſſe to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, now in the worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this Sacrament, then wee are aſſured of the exteriour ſymboles and Sacraments. If an Angel from Heauen ſhould come and tel you theſe things, then would you reioyce and be glad. And my deare hearts in the Lord, I; euen now, though moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, am ſent of the Lord to tel you no leſſe, but that you worthily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this Sacrament, ſhall receiue remiſſion of all your ſinnes, or rather
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16991:82"/>certaintie that they are remitted, and that you are euen now Gods Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Temples, and fellow inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of all the good that euer hee hath. Wherefore, ſée that you giue thankes vnto the Lord for this his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and prayſe his Name for euer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">An obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing.</note>Oh, ſaith one, I could be glad in very deed, and giue thanks from my very heart, if that I did worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this Sacrament. But (alas) I am a very grieuous ſinner, and I féele in my ſelfe very little repentance and faith; and therefore I am afeard that I am vnworthy.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note>To the anſwering of this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I think it neceſſary to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the worthy receiuing of this Sacrament, in as great breuitie and plaineneſſe as I can. The Apoſtle willeth all men to proue and examine themſelues, before they eate of the Bread, and drinke of the Cup: for they that eate and drinke vnworthily, eate and drinke their owne damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Therefore, this probation and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16991:82"/>is neceſſary. If men will try their Gold and Siluer, whether they bee Copper or no: is it not more neceſſary, that men ſhould trie their conſciences? Now, how this ſhould bée, the Papiſts teach amiſſe, in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs to their auricular Confeſſion, which is impoſſible. The true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and tryall of a Chriſt an con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, conſiſteth altogether in Faith and Repentance. Faith, hath reſpect to the Doctrine and Articles of our Beliefe: Repentance, hath reſpect to manners and conuerſation. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the former, I meane of Faith, wee may ſee the Apoſtle teacheth vs, <hi>2. Corinthians 11.</hi> Concerning the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for our conuerſation, thoſe ſinnes which are commonly called mortal, or deadly, are to be remoued. Theſe ſins are diſcerned from other ſins, by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 6.</hi> in ſaying: <hi>Let not ſinne raigne and beare ſway in your mortall bodies.</hi> For truely, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Howbeit, if wee ſtriue againſt it, if it diſpleaſe vs, then truly, thogh ſinne be in vs (for wee ought to obey God without all reſiſtance, or vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe) yet our ſins be not of thoſe ſinnes, which ſeparate vs from God, but for Chriſts ſake ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto vs beléeuing.</p>
            <p>Therefore, my dearely beloued, if that your ſinnes doe now diſpleaſe you, if you purpoſe vnfainedly to bee enemies to ſinne in your ſelues and in others, as you may, during your whole life, if you hope in Chriſt for pardon, if you beleeue, according to the holy Scriptures and Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, ſet forth in your Creede: if, I ſay, you now truſt in Gods merey, through Chriſts merits; if, you repent, and earneſtly purpoſe before God to amend your life, and to giue ouer your ſelues to ſerue the Lord, in holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of your life: although before this preſent, you haue moſt grieuouſly ſinned; I publiſh vnto
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16991:83"/>you, that you are worthy gheſts for this Table, you ſhall be welcome to Chriſt, your ſinnes ſhall be pardoned, you ſhall be endued with his Spirit, and ſo with Communion with him and the Father, &amp; the whole Church of God, Chriſt will dwell in you, and you ſhall dwell in him for euermore.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, behaue your ſelues accordingly, with ioyfulnes &amp; thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.

Flie from ſinne, as from a Loade; come away from Popery, and all Antichriſtian Religion; be diligent in your vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be diligent &amp; earneſt in Prayer; hearken to the voyce of God in his Word with reuerence; liue worthy your profeſſion.
